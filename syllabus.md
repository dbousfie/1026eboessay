Essay Bibliography & Outline and Essay
Politics requires us to listen to arguments, read analyse, and engage with others ideas. One important aspect of Political Science, thus, is learning to write clear, strong, well-researched and properly argued essay. This is an important and impressive skill to master as you go through your university education and for opportunities beyond after graduation.

What is Scaffolding?
In order to help you learn to do this and develop those skills, we use a Scaffolding process to help you learn to write a strong essay.  What is Scaffolding? "Vygotsky coined a definition of instructional scaffolding that focused on teacher practices. He defined this as, ‘the role of teachers and others in supporting the learner’s development and providing support structures to get to that next stage or level’ (Raymond, 2000)."(1) More to the point, Loveless says, "Scaffolding .. was defined as breaking up learning into chunks so that students tackled increasingly more complex material."(2) So, think of our Essay Assignments process like a Video game: every level you gain new education skills/powers, and then you use them to do well on the next assignment which levels up from the last one.

So how does the Scaffolding work?
Essay Bibliography and Outline (EBO): We will show you how to find peer-reviewed Academic sources for your EBO. You will have access to videos and other materials to find quality, scholarly sources, and an Essay Bibliography Worksheet that will help you work through how to find those sources.  From there, you will collect and write up those sources following either Modern Language Association (MLA) or Chicago 16th edition in the Essay Bibliography & Outline Worksheet, which you will submit. For the Outline portion, after reading and reviewing your sources, you will write down your 'arguments, objections & replies' so we can help you develop strong arguments and ensure your arguments have support in and draw from your sources. A strong Essay Outline, as you will see, has a clear, focussed thesis -- your central argument you are supporting/proving through the course of your essay -- and supporting arguments, as well as taking account of counter-arguments. You will complete these tasks using the Essay Bibliography & Outline Worksheet, which you will submit.
Essay: You pull together your research into a 1500-word Essay. Your EBO's sources & arguments will help you develop and write your Final Essay. The Final Essay has particular components – thesis, arguments, counter-arguments, citations, bibliography etc. – and show your ability to make coherent, interconnected, well-written, well-researched and well-argued analyses of and arguments about your essay topic.
Therefore, in our class, you will complete two assignments which comprise the Essay. Details for each of these assignments are listed below.

EBO Frequently-Asked Questions (EBO FAQs)
“The difference between ‘reAd it’ and ‘reDdit’ is an A versus a D” 
– Nig Narain

Late Updated: Nov 8
(Note that some of the direction it's giving is not fully nuanced or correct, so it's your responsibility to review all the information posted on the OWL site to confirm the AI gave you correct information and correct it yourself, and even the AI Bot always cautions: "There may be errors in my responses; always refer to the course web page.")

ALSO, topic-specific questions are answer on the Essay-FAQ page, while more general EBO questions are discussed below.

Highly recommend you talk to your TA.

Should I read the Essay pages and watch all the Videos on how to do Research?
Yes
Then, contact your TA to get any questions answered
You can also email me BUT you should be talking/chatting with your TAs
Is this an annotated bibliography?
No
Nowhere is it stated that it it an annotated bibliography, so don't invent requirements (or mislead others, thanks)
If you did end up writing one, we will simply disregard it AND you still must meet all other requirements for this assignment
Can I change my sources as I do more research?
Yes!
Improve your sources and get better research
Can I change my Essay topic from what I write about in my EBO?
If you change your essay's topic-question from what you wrote for the EBO, you will get 0/zero for the EBO retroactively, i.e. lose the EBO grade = 0% but still get your full Essay grade
What if something does not have proper page numbers on the document?
Articles all have page numbers, so you have to do a little digging to find the page numbers
You need to provide page numbers for all your articles, e.g. 725-738
Do I have to do one of the topics listed in the Essay Assignment?
Yes
Picking your own topic will result in a 0/zero being assigned and zero/0 for your grade for the EBO and/or Essay
Do I just need only 4 book/ebook sources in total for full marks?
No: a minimum is exactly that a minimum
 4 = 2.5/passing grade SO: 5 = 3, 6 = 4,  7+ = 5
If you have less than 4, you will get less/lower marks
Do I just need only 7 article sources in total for full marks?
No: a minimum is exactly that a minimum
 7 = 2.5/passing grade SO: 8 = 3, 9 = 4,  10+ = 5
If you have less than 7, you will get less/lower marks
How do I come up with keywords?
Watch the video links posted and check out the Powerpoint.
Your keywords should come from the topic and you'll have to work through what you want to focus on, etc.
Your keywords must be relevant to the topic and not generalities, etc., that would gives us a relevant result 
For example, if the topic was War Crimes and Yugoslavia,
Your keywords & synonyms could be:
war crimes > genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity
International Criminal Court > UN, Security Council, The Hague
Yugoslavia > Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia
Do I have to provide pages for Books or eBooks in the EBO?
Not if it's a monograph: "A monograph is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to reference works) on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author, and usually on a scholarly subject."
E.g. Narain, Nigmendra. Friendly Arms, Killing Enemies: Building Oversees Organizational Kabals. Western University Press, 2020. < you only list the book, not the pages you plan to use, the particular chapters you want to use, etc.
IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, then: yes (see below)
Do I have to provide page numbers for chapters from edited books e-books? 
IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, you should provide page #s
Example in MLA style:  Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". Psychoanalysis and the Global. Edited and with an Introduction by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
Do I have to provide page numbers for articles? 
Yes
Example in MLA style: Bousfield, Dan. “Revisiting Cyber-Diplomacy: Canada–China Relations Online.” Globalizations, vol. 14, no. 6, Aug. 2017, pp. 1045–59, doi:10.1080/14747731.2017.1362176.
Do I have to check the Citation listing when I copy it from the Library Citation generator, ezBib, etc.?
YES ABSOLUTELY!
Check to make sure the name of the journal and the page numbers are there in particular, as these two tend to be the info often missing when there is an error in auto-generators 
Can I list sources from 2009 and earlier?
We are looking for sources published/written from 2010 onwards
If you use sources from 2009 or older, we just won't count them towards your total number of sources
Do I have to provide DOIs and URLs?
Not required but can include if you want to, and no marks take off/gained for having them
However: if it is strictly a website page (like the UN.org or irpp.org page), a web-report (as in there is no PDF of the UN's report), etc., then you would need the URL BUT note this is not the type of sources you want in the EBO, as the EBO is about scholarly, academic sources which happen to be on & accessed through multiple portal websites (Weldon's system, JSTOR, Ebsco, etc.)
After I get my EBO back, can I change my argument, counter-argument, rebuttal, examples/case studies, sources, as I do more research?
Yes!
Improve your sources and get better research > use the new sources in your essay, and you can replace the sources from your EBO if they no longer are as useful
Make better or different arguments, counter-arguments, rebuttals as you work through your research, so do improve and change as needed
Change your examples or case studies so you have a better fit with/evidence for your arguments, etc.
Is the thesis one sentence only ?
Yes
One sentence AND your supporting arguments can be put come afterwards (second, third, etc., sentences)
If you want to add some nuance or parameters that are reasonable, that is okay: 'I argue globalization has been positive in terms economic globalization' or ''This essay argues nuclear weapons should not be banned for states but should be banned non-state actors'
Your thesis is your main claim or position in response to the question your essay is addressing, so it is the main point or goal or purpose you are going to defend with arguments and evidence
You should state your thesis as a single sentence, such as “I argue …” or “The state’s policy on gambling should be …”
If you have reasons or arguments in support of this position, you should put those in the next sentence or sentences
Don't provide your counter-arguments in the thesis, but you can provide in your Introduction para
Don't provide any rebuttals in the thesis or Introductory para
Also, what you argue is up to you as long as your thesis is reasonable and can be supported by the evidence in the sources 
If you want to open with a 'hook' or 'teaser' statement before rolling into your thesis, etc., that's fine but save that for your Essay, e.g. "If not for globalization, would we have our computers, watches, phones and the Good LIfe? However, globalization created for those who produce the electronics and other stuff we consume a life that is barely life, much less a 'good life'. In this essay, I argue ..."
Does my thesis only have to be a response to the question?
It is clearest if you simply state your thesis as a response: 'I argue that the state should put limits on free speech' or 'This essay argues the American War on Terror has failed'
Can I make more than 3 main arguments to support the thesis?
No, please don't
Aim for depth: make you main argument supported by strong arguments, evidence, etc., which needs you to have depth in your arguments
It's like a good date: 2-3 good date events/things/places are better than 10 events packed in and no time for depth of experience, i.e. no time with the other person/persons
How many sentences per argument/opposing/rebuttal?
3-5 sentences is fine per each
Argument: 3-5 sentences
Counter-argument: 3-5 sentences
Rebuttal: 3-5 sentences
DON'T dump an entire paragraph or paragraphs for each
Goal: tell the reader what your arguing and why 
5 sentences is a maximum
Can I use bullet-points for the AOR part of the Essay Outline
Bullet-points are ok IF you write sentences and provide proper and necessary information
Best to follow the same as the sentences point above: 3-5 bullet points
Do I need to provide sources, citations or bibliography for the Essay Outline?
No
If you do, that's fine but we won't add or take away from your grade for this
May I include my arguments or an elaboration?
It is preferable not include them in the thesis but to provide them in the sentences which follow
However, some topics may actually be better served by doing so (so it's your call in that case), such as 'I argue Western European youth are not participating in formal politics because elections are not live-streamed on Twitch and TikTok partying features only EDM dub-step parties not political parties"
Do I have to use 'I'? Can I say 'This essay argues...', 'My argument is that...', 'The position taken here is...'
Yes, those are all fine as long you are focussing on arguing, asserting, and making claims (not 'I feel that' or 'it shook me to see')
If I have found other sources, etc., so do I need to re-submit the EBO? Do I need to check the new sources with my TA?
No
You should always be on look for better and more useful sources
You don't need to check them with your TA but make sure you're using academic sources 
Do I have to provide examples or case studies?
If your question is asking you focus on case studies, then it would be good to mention your selections are part of your argument or counter-argument
If it's just some general example you want to mention to get advice, etc., that's fie
Not required but can be helpful
Can I change my examples or case studies,
Yes, BUT if your essay question has specific guidelines (e.g. Western Europe), then your case studies must still conform to that requirements
What if I catch a last minute error so can I resubmit?
You can but ONLY UNTIL the deadline can you resubmit a corrected version > it will override your old submission with the new one ONLY if submitted by the deadline time
No submissions after the link is closed
What if the link closes as I'm submitting?
If you are uploading, and OWL is uploading your file, but it rolls past the deadline, it will just show as "Late" BUT that Late indicates OWL did upload it so you're good and won't be penalized as late
What do I do if I missed the on-time submission deadline and the link is closed?
It's late SO keep working on it and then submit at the next available deadline
What do I do if I missed the late submission deadline and the link is closed?
Unless you have accommodation, you will NOT be permitted to submit the assignment and will receive 0
What is the difference between a Book and an Edited book?
A Book is also called a Monograph with one author (or could be many authors) and each chapter is written by that author, not multiple authors
E.g.: Whitworth, Sandra. Feminism and International Relations : Towards a Political Economy of Gender in Interstate and Non-Governmental Institutions. St. Martin’s Press, 1994.
An Edited Book has chapter-articles which are written by various authors, so each chapter has the author of each chapter listed in the table of contents, so in your EBO, you'd list each chapter-article separately with its author, e.g.:
Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". Psychoanalysis and the Global. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
Sioh, Maureen, Dan“The Logic of Humiliation in Financial Conquest.” Psychoanalysis and the Global. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 44-60.
Can I list each chapter of a monograph Book as separate EBO listings?
NO
So for Whitworth, Sandra. Feminism and International Relations : Towards a Political Economy of Gender in Interstate and Non-Governmental Institutions  , you can't list each of its chapters
How many chapter-articles can I use from any one Edited Book?
You can use 2 chapter-articles from the same book
NOTE: the Edited book listed full itself will only count for 1 and cannot be considered a separate listing, so if you listed these 3 below, only 2 would count (the full book listing is #2 below):
Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". Psychoanalysis and the Global. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
Kapoor, Ilan, ed. Psychoanalysis and the Global. University of Nebraska Press, 2018.
Sioh, Maureen, Dan“The Logic of Humiliation in Financial Conquest.” Psychoanalysis and the Global. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 44-60.
Is there a significant difference between MLA 8 vs MLA 9?
No
Librarians confirmed the types of sources we are asking for in the EBO and Essay are no affected by the differences between MLA 8 vs. MLA 9



## Submitting Cautions, Caveats, Rules, etc.

### Essay On-Time Submission:

**Essay assignment Due via OWL site Wednesday, December 3, 2025 (11:59pm)**
*(no penalty applied if submitted by Tuesday, December 9, 2025, 11:59pm)*

---

### Concerning “Undocumented Absence” Academic Consideration:

* You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if this Essay deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise).
* This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without penalty, to **Tuesday, December 9**, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Due Date of **Wednesday, December 3**.

**TO BE CLEAR:** this does not mean the Essay is “really” due on Tuesday, December 9; it is due on Wednesday, December 3. But after Tuesday, December 9 at **11:59pm**, the Essay is considered late. We will still accept submission until **Wednesday, December 10 at 11:00pm**, with a late penalty of -10% applied.

Again, a request for academic consideration will not be considered if submitting between **Wednesday, December 3** and **Wednesday, December 10**, because an extension was already granted, and the Essay is now late.

* Per Senate Regulations: *“An instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline.”* ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic\_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
* Per Office of the Registrar FAQ: *“When CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied.”* ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic\_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
* If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic\_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html)) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration.
* If you have documented grounds for a late submission beyond **December 10**, in that case, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration.
* Those students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines through Accessible Education should check the OWL site for your particular AE dates and other details and notes. < Per AE office: there is no further accommodation needed.

**THE LATE PENALTY IS A FLAT -10% PENALTY**

---

### Essay Late Penalty Submission:

**Wednesday, December 10, 2025, 11:00pm: Essay assignment Due via OWL site (with -10% penalty applied)**
*(no penalty applied if submitted by Tuesday, December 17, 2025, 11:59pm)*

---

### Concerning “Undocumented Absence” Academic Consideration (Late Penalty):

* You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if this Essay Late Penalty deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise).
* This is because an extension will be granted automatically to the **Late Penalty Submission** (i.e. only the -10% penalty will apply), to **Tuesday, December 17**, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Late Penalty Due Date of **Wednesday, December 10**.

**TO BE CLEAR:** this does not mean the Late Essay is “really” due on Tuesday, December 17; it is due on Wednesday, December 10. But after Tuesday, December 17 at **11:59pm**, the Late Essay cannot be submitted without Academic Consideration.

Again, a request for academic consideration for the Late Essay will not be considered if submitting between **Wednesday, December 10** and **Tuesday, December 17**, because an extension was already granted.

* Per Senate Regulations: *“An instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline.”*
* Per Office of the Registrar FAQ: *“When CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied.”*
* If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic\_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html)) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration.

How do I Approach Writing an Essay for Political Science?
Why should I read this Essay writing guide?

There are many writing guides available in the Bookstore and Libraries. Below is a guide that focuses on our Poli Sci 1026 Essay. It proceeds by asking common and reasonable essay-related questions and then proceeds to answer them so you can write a strong, well-argued, well-evidenced essay. The goal is to provide you effective direction and guidance, and avoid many of the common mistakes and pitfalls that befuddle essays. 

What is an Argumentative Essay?

You will be writing An Argumentative Essay. This is one type of essay and its main goal is to defend a thesis by giving supporting reasons and evidence. Thus, you should write a clear thesis – your position on the question – which you will support through making arguments, providing evidence from sources, and addressing objections to your thesis. Before you write your essay or develop your thesis, make sure you understand the question and spend some time brainstorming responses. As well, do read all the sources so you will know what is the breadth and depth of the issue.  Thus, your essay should be using the approach of “This essay argues” or “I will argue” as the catalyst and frame for doing the essay (it is okay to use “I” in the essay if you prefer, but either way is fine).

When do I start the Essay?
Now.

Who is the audience for your essay?
While your essay will likely only be read by you and the Marker who marks your essay, you should not be writing with that marker or Professor in mind. Instead, consider writing the essay with a fellow student in mind. This is a good strategy because it will force you to write so another person can read it and understand it. You will avoid writing an obtuse, inaccessible or jargon-filled essay. Instead, your essay will be readable by anyone because you have written it clearly and succinctly, explaining or defining terms, and make arguments that can be understood. As well, you will provide proper evidence and examples to that the reader can intelligently and readily follow your arguments and see they are supported.  Another important point: you will need to walk your reader through the essay step-by-step so you will need to develop your ideas to show them, rather than assume they are self-evident because you stated them. In other words, your ideas and evidence need to convince the average reasonably informed reader, so write accordingly.

What is the thesis?
Your thesis is your main claim or position in response to the question your essay is addressing. Your thesis is the main point or goal or purpose you are going to defend with arguments and evidence. You should state your thesis as a single sentence, such as “I argue …” or “The state’s policy on gambling should be …”. If you have reasons or arguments in support of this position, you can put those in the next sentence or sentences. Also, once you have completed your whole essay, go back and check over your thesis to make sure you have argued and supported your thesis – otherwise change your thesis so that it concords with what you have argued and proven in the essay. Also, what you argue is up to you as long as your thesis is reasonable and can be supported by the evidence in the sources.

What should be in my Introduction?
The Introduction is the first paragraph of your essay and it should, above all else, tell us what is your topic-question and what is your thesis. . You must state the question you have chosen (if not the question itself, then a reasonable version of it without changing the question focus) and, in the next sentence, state your thesis. Then, consider answering the ‘so what’ question: why is this topic important to consider? Give us some idea why this might be an important topic in your view. You can also provide some context or background that you think is relevant. However, avoid ‘cosmic clichés’ or ‘grandiose claims’ like ‘since the dawn of time’, ‘there is only one issue that has ever mattered to anyone’, etc. As well, you may give us a ‘road map’ of your essay that gives a preview of how your essay is structured and flows (this helps the reader know how you are going to proceed through the essay). In addition, you may want to define select terms that have specific meanings or definitions, but you do not need to define everything and some of these terms may be better defined in the body of your essay. In short, the Introduction should ensure that, at the least, the reader:

Knows the question which the essay is addressing (the essay question)
Knows your position or claim in response to the question (your thesis)
Understands why you think the topic is important to consider
Note, however, a simple Introduction – just doing the above in 3 sentences – is a bad Introduction as it should also introduce or contextualize the topic and question, and show you understand the topic and question more fully than just the bear minimum. Also, you can put your thesis wherever you think is appropriate but ensure you use words – ‘This essay argues’, ‘The claim here is’, ‘I will prove that’ – to make clear the thesis to the reader – it is the writer’s job to make sure their thesis can be identified and understood by the reader in the essay.

What is the Body?
The Body is not a single thing; the Body of your essay is many paragraphs composed of many sentences. Do not write a ‘hamburger’ or ‘3 para’ essay for 1500-words, across 55-6 pages – such essays do badly. The Body has many paragraphs, and these paragraphs will bring forward your arguments and their evidence, the objections to your thesis & their evidence, and your reply to the objections.

Thus, you will need many paragraphs to do this – and many sentences (minimum of 3) inside each paragraph. Think of each paragraph as ‘unit of thought’: opening sentence is sign-post telling the reader what the paragraph is about; then put forward your argument or arguments; provide the evidence, sources and support for those arguments; and, close the paragraph by summarizing for the reader the main point of the paragraph. Thus, the first sentence of the paragraph should tell us what the paragraph will put forward but also how it is connected to the paragraph before it, e.g. ‘I begin by arguing ‘no platform…’ so next paragraph may start ‘Having covered ‘no platform’, we can now look at the first objection to this …’. Thus, the Body will bring forward your various arguments and your researched evidence.

What is the ‘Argument, Objection, Reply’ (AOR) format?
While your thesis is your main claim, you will need to make arguments. Well-argued essays generally will follow Graff & Birkenstein’s ‘They Say/I Say’ format which focuses on laying out arguments and analyses of others and then responding to them. In the case of our essay, we are suggesting a modified version of this. First, show the reader your main Argument (in support of your thesis): what are you arguing in order to prove your thesis and what is your evidence and support for this argument from your sources? Next, show the reader an Objection or Objections to your argument, again providing evidence that backs up the objection – this is also called a ‘charitable’ presentation of the objection(s) because you want to show the reader you understand and can present the objection properly, not sloppily or dismissively. Finally, Reply to the Objections: what do you argue to refute, oppose, disprove the Objections, based on evidence and sources. In all cases, you are using your sources to provide evidence to back up your arguments, objections and replies. In addition, the AOR format will ensure you show you can reason and understand your thesis with a number of supporting arguments, but also defend against reasoned and understood objections. This also creates a conversation flow to your essay, so the reader sees your arguments develop and will see if you can defend them against objections.

How many arguments do you need to support your thesis? Here it is important to stress we are looking for quality not quantity. For example, if you decide to make 6 arguments with objections and replies, your essay will have no depth and lack sources and evidence to support them – an argument every 350 words. However, if you do 3 arguments, and their objections and replies, you are more likely to have depth – evidence, examples, sources and quotes – to support your thesis, and will do better on the essay.  Thus, do not aim for quantity of arguments but depth of arguments.

So, what makes a good Argument’? A good argument puts forward a reasonable point or claim that links to the thesis, then seeks to prove it with evidence, sources, quotes, examples, etc.  A good argument supports the thesis and is itself supported. Consequently, the good argument is reasonable, defensible and evidenced. It also follows the saying: “Show me, don’t tell me”; in other words, prove it with evidence and sources to persuade the reader, and do not rely on or demand the reader has to take your word for it (they will not as they are expecting you to do your job and prove your points).

So, what makes a good Objection and good Reply? In both cases, as with a Good Argument, you need to provide evidence and proof. As well, you need to provide ‘charitable’ presentation of the Objection; this means present it properly with evidence, as if you were making that as your argument, and do not simply choose those parts of the Objection that are easy to shoot down because they are, in fact, an incomplete or incorrect or skewed presentation of the Objection. Give the Objection a reasonably positive or favourable presentation before your Reply – critique, disprove or pull apart – to the Objection. Once you have laid out the Objection, think of a strong Reply to the Objection, and make sure you provide evidence to back up your Reply. Again, as with the good Argument, choose quality over quantity, so you have depth to your analysis.

Also, don’t be shy: edit and be a ruthless editor. Pick only your strongest arguments to put forward, that is, arguments you can discuss and prove with depth, i.e. sources and evidence. Similarly, pick the best Objections and Reply to them. Avoid choosing ‘novel’ or ‘unique’ arguments for the sake of ‘being different’; novelty without depth is not going to receive a good grade.

What is the Conclusion?
The Conclusion ties together your essay. In it, you want to remind the reader of the question you responded to, your thesis, and a summary of your arguments, objections and replies. Never introduce new information, arguments, etc., that has not already been argued or discussed in the essay. In addition, based on what you have argued, you are welcome to suggest further research questions or ideas others can research or analyse.

Why do I need to Revise, Review or have a Friend look it over?
Avoid submitting your first-and-only version of your essay. You need to learn to manage your time to research, to write, and give yourself time to edit. A great saying from one of prof’s: “Writing is easy; re-writing is hard”; editing means looking over your words, making sure you have selected the right words to make your points, or provided the best evidence to support your arguments, or ensuring your arguments prove your thesis, or making sure your spelling and grammar are not problematic or incorrect. One way to avoid a lot of errors: have a friend or someone else read it over because sometimes what you have written is not the same as what was in your mind or your choice of words does not make that point.  Many essays drop in overall grade because of careless errors and problems which make them difficult to read, flow or understand, and all that could have been avoided by taking a few minutes to edit the essay. As well, note that Clarity and Organization are important criteria in assessing your essay, so get someone to read over and critique your essay, so it is clearer and better argued.

Why I should cite from the my Sources?
It is important to cite your ideas, quotations, etc., to show the reader you got those materials from Sources. The more you use your Sources in the essay and provide the citations, it is likely you will do better because the TA will see you have used all sources and have grappled with the issue in the different. When you cite, you are giving a clear indication to the reader your ideas are supported, backed or drawing on others who have made similar arguments or provide proof for your ideas. Similarly, for Objections and Replies, sources show you properly understand the other sides to the debate, that is, you did not just pull stuff out of the air.

How should I incorporate my Sources into my essay?
There are many ways to do this. You can do the well-known ‘quotation sandwich’: introduce the quote or quote’s author, then provide the quote, and then explain the point or connection of the quote to your argument. You can claim ‘As Narain argues, …” and paraphrase their point (don’t use some or part of their words; if you are using their words, then just quote them). You can provide your evidence or discuss your examples, etc., and then cite the source where it comes from. Again, all this will help the reader to know you did your research and have understood the necessary ideas, etc. As well, you will do better on your essay overall because you will have proven and supported your claims.

What is Plagiarism?
If you pass off other people’s word, ideas, examples, etc., as your own in your essay, that will constitute plagiarism. Just as you do not want someone to steal your ideas, words, etc., do not steal those of others, either. The Course Outline, the Appendices, and various documents on UWO’s websites provide fuller details of the standards and possible punishments.

Can I bring in a draft to be read?
While we will not be reading over drafts.

Any final advice?
YES: Pick an Essay topic-question that you will enjoy doing – if you have fun doing it, you will likely do better on it. If you have questions or concerns, please talk to Dan or Nig; we are always ready to help and guide you.

 Good luck! 

Can't Use Undocumented Absence for EBO
You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if the EBO deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise).

This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without penalty, to Tuesday, October 14, 2025, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Due Date of Wednesday, October 8, 2025.

TO BE CLEAR: this does not mean the EBO is “really” due on Tuesday, October 14, 2025. It is due on Wednesday, October 8, 2025. But after Tuesday, October 14, 2025, at 11:59pm, the EBO is considered late. We will still accept submission until Wednesday, October 15, 2025, at 11:59pm with a late penalty of -10% applied.

Again, a request for academic consideration will not be considered if submitting between Wednesday, October 8, 2025 and Wednesday, October 15, 2025, because an extension was already granted, and the EBO is now late.

If you have documented grounds for a late submission extension beyond Wednesday, October 1


Per Senate Regulations: “An instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
Per Office of the Registrar FAQ “When CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied.” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
If you have documented grounds for a late submission extension beyond November 15, in that case, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
Those students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines through Accessible Education (AE) should check the OWL site for your particular AE dates and other details and notes
