## **Essay On-Time Submission:**

**Mon Feb 24 11:59pm: Essay assignment Due via OWL site \
> no penalty applied if submitted by Fri Feb 28 11:59pm**



* Concerning ‚ÄúUndocumented Absence‚Äù Academic Consideration:
    * You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if this Essay deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise)
    * This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without penalty, to Friday, February 28, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Due Date of Monday, February 24
    * TO BE CLEAR: this does not mean the Essay is ‚Äúreally‚Äù due on Friday, February 28; it is due on Monday, February 24, but after Friday, February 28 11:55pm, the Essay is considered late, but we will still accept submission until Friday, March 7, with a late penalty of -10% applied
    * Again, a request for academic consideration will not be considered if submitting between Monday, February 24, and Friday, March 7, because an extension was already granted, and the Essay is now late
    * Per Senate Regulations: ‚ÄúAn instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline‚Äù ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
    * Per Office of the Registrar FAQ ‚ÄúWhen CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied‚Äù ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
* If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar‚Äôs Academic Consideration page [https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
* If you have documented grounds for a late submission beyond March 7, in that case, you should read the Registrar‚Äôs Academic Consideration page [https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
* Those students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines through Accessible Education should check the OWL site for your particular AE dates and other details and notes *&lt; per AE office: there is no further accommodation needed*
* ***THE LATE PENALTY IS A FLAT -10% PENALTY***


## **Essay Late Penalty Submission:**

**Mon Mar 3 11:59pm: Essay assignment Due via OWL site \
> no penalty applied if submitted by Fri Mar 7 11:59pm**



* Concerning ‚ÄúUndocumented Absence‚Äù Academic Consideration:
    * You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if this Essay deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise)
    * This is because an extension will be granted automatically to the Late Penalty Submission, without *further *penalty (i.e. only the -10% penalty will apply), to Friday, March 7, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Essay Late Penalty Due Date of Monday, March 3
    * TO BE CLEAR: this does not mean the Late Essay  is ‚Äúreally‚Äù due on Friday, March 7; it is due on Monday, March 3, but after Friday, March 7, 11:59pm, the Late Essay cannot be submitted without Academic Consideration
    * Again, a request for academic consideration for the Late Essay will not be considered if submitting between Monday, March 3, and Friday, March 7, because an extension was already granted
    * Per Senate Regulations: ‚ÄúAn instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline‚Äù ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))

# *Scaffolding: Why an Essay AND an EBO?*


---

***Politics requires us to listen to arguments, read analyse, and engage with others ideas. One important aspect of Political Science, thus, is learning to write clear, strong, well-researched and properly argued essay. This is an important and impressive skill to master as you go through your university education and for opportunities beyond after graduation.***


#### ***What is Scaffolding?***

***In order to help you learn to do this and develop those skills, we use a Scaffolding process to help you learn to write a strong essay.  What is Scaffolding? "Vygotsky coined a definition of instructional scaffolding that focused on teacher practices. He defined this as, ‚Äòthe role of teachers and others in supporting the learner‚Äôs development and providing support structures to get to that next stage or level‚Äô (Raymond, 2000)."(1) More to the point, Loveless says, "Scaffolding .. was defined as breaking up learning into chunks so that students tackled increasingly more complex material."(2) So, think of our Essay Assignments process like a Video game: every level you gain new education skills/powers, and then you use them to do well on the next assignment which levels up from the last one.***


#### ***So how does the Scaffolding work?***



1. ***Essay Bibliography and Outline (EBO): We will show you how to find peer-reviewed Academic sources for your EBO. You will have access to videos and other materials to find quality, scholarly sources, and an Essay Bibliography Worksheet that will help you work through how to find those sources.  From there, you will collect and write up those sources following either Modern Language Association (MLA) or Chicago 16th edition in the Essay Bibliography & Outline Worksheet, which you will submit. For the Outline portion, after reading and reviewing your sources, you will write down your 'arguments, objections & replies' so we can help you develop strong arguments and ensure your arguments have support in and draw from your sources. A strong Essay Outline, as you will see, has a clear, focussed thesis -- your central argument you are supporting/proving through the course of your essay -- and supporting arguments, as well as taking account of counter-arguments. You will complete these tasks using the Essay Bibliography & Outline Worksheet, which you will submit.***
2. ***Final Essay: You pull together your research into a 1500-word Essay. Your EBO's sources & arguments will help you develop and write your Final Essay. The Final Essay has particular components ‚Äì thesis, arguments, counter-arguments, citations, bibliography etc. ‚Äì and show your ability to make coherent, interconnected, well-written, well-researched and well-argued analyses of and arguments about your essay topic.***

***Therefore, in our class, you will complete two assignments which comprise the Essay. Details for each of these assignments are listed below. In terms of timeline, in Term 1, you submit the Essay Bibliography & Outlinee, and you will submit your Final Essay in Term 2.***

**Why should I read this Essay writing guide?**

There are many writing guides available in the Bookstore and Libraries. Below is a guide that focuses on our Poli Sci 1026 Essay. It proceeds by asking common and reasonable essay-related questions and then proceeds to answer them so you can write a strong, well-argued, well-evidenced essay. The goal is to provide you effective direction and guidance, and avoid many of the common mistakes and pitfalls that befuddle essays. 

**What is an Argumentative Essay?**

You will be writing An Argumentative Essay. This is one type of essay and its main goal is to defend a thesis by giving supporting reasons and evidence. Thus, you should write a clear thesis ‚Äì your position on the question ‚Äì which you will support through making arguments, providing evidence from sources, and addressing objections to your thesis. Before you write your essay or develop your thesis, make sure you understand the question and spend some time brainstorming responses. As well, do read all the sources so you will know what is the breadth and depth of the issue.  Thus, your essay should be using the approach of ‚ÄúThis essay argues‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will argue‚Äù as the catalyst and frame for doing the essay (it is okay to use ‚ÄúI‚Äù in the essay if you prefer, but either way is fine).

When do I start the Essay? \
Now.

Who is the audience for your essay? \
While your essay will likely only be read by you and the Marker who marks your essay, you should not be writing with that marker or Professor in mind. Instead, consider writing the essay with a fellow student in mind. This is a good strategy because it will force you to write so another person can read it and understand it. You will avoid writing an obtuse, inaccessible or jargon-filled essay. Instead, your essay will be readable by anyone because you have written it clearly and succinctly, explaining or defining terms, and make arguments that can be understood. As well, you will provide proper evidence and examples to that the reader can intelligently and readily follow your arguments and see they are supported.  Another important point: you will need to walk your reader through the essay step-by-step so you will need to develop your ideas to show them, rather than assume they are self-evident because you stated them. In other words, your ideas and evidence need to convince the average reasonably informed reader, so write accordingly.

What is the thesis? \
Your thesis is your main claim or position in response to the question your essay is addressing. Your thesis is the main point or goal or purpose you are going to defend with arguments and evidence. You should state your thesis as a single sentence, such as ‚ÄúI argue ‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs policy on gambling should be ‚Ä¶‚Äù. If you have reasons or arguments in support of this position, you can put those in the next sentence or sentences. Also, once you have completed your whole essay, go back and check over your thesis to make sure you have argued and supported your thesis ‚Äì otherwise change your thesis so that it concords with what you have argued and proven in the essay. Also, what you argue is up to you as long as your thesis is reasonable and can be supported by the evidence in the sources.

What should be in my Introduction? \
The Introduction is the first paragraph of your essay and it should, above all else, tell us what is your topic-question and what is your thesis. . You must state the question you have chosen (if not the question itself, then a reasonable version of it without changing the question focus) and, in the next sentence, state your thesis. Then, consider answering the ‚Äòso what‚Äô question: why is this topic important to consider? Give us some idea why this might be an important topic in your view. You can also provide some context or background that you think is relevant. However, avoid ‚Äòcosmic clich√©s‚Äô or ‚Äògrandiose claims‚Äô like ‚Äòsince the dawn of time‚Äô, ‚Äòthere is only one issue that has ever mattered to anyone‚Äô, etc. As well, you may give us a ‚Äòroad map‚Äô of your essay that gives a preview of how your essay is structured and flows (this helps the reader know how you are going to proceed through the essay). In addition, you may want to define select terms that have specific meanings or definitions, but you do not need to define everything and some of these terms may be better defined in the body of your essay. In short, the Introduction should ensure that, at the least, the reader:

Knows the question which the essay is addressing (the essay question) \
Knows your position or claim in response to the question (your thesis) \
Understands why you think the topic is important to consider \
Note, however, a simple Introduction ‚Äì just doing the above in 3 sentences ‚Äì is a bad Introduction as it should also introduce or contextualize the topic and question, and show you understand the topic and question more fully than just the bear minimum. Also, you can put your thesis wherever you think is appropriate but ensure you use words ‚Äì ‚ÄòThis essay argues‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe claim here is‚Äô, ‚ÄòI will prove that‚Äô ‚Äì to make clear the thesis to the reader ‚Äì it is the writer‚Äôs job to make sure their thesis can be identified and understood by the reader in the essay.

What is the Body? \
The Body is not a single thing; the Body of your essay is many paragraphs composed of many sentences. Do not write a ‚Äòhamburger‚Äô or ‚Äò3 para‚Äô essay for 1500-words, across 55-6 pages ‚Äì such essays do badly. The Body has many paragraphs, and these paragraphs will bring forward your arguments and their evidence, the objections to your thesis & their evidence, and your reply to the objections.

Thus, you will need many paragraphs to do this ‚Äì and many sentences (minimum of 3) inside each paragraph. Think of each paragraph as ‚Äòunit of thought‚Äô: opening sentence is sign-post telling the reader what the paragraph is about; then put forward your argument or arguments; provide the evidence, sources and support for those arguments; and, close the paragraph by summarizing for the reader the main point of the paragraph. Thus, the first sentence of the paragraph should tell us what the paragraph will put forward but also how it is connected to the paragraph before it, e.g. ‚ÄòI begin by arguing ‚Äòno platform‚Ä¶‚Äô so next paragraph may start ‚ÄòHaving covered ‚Äòno platform‚Äô, we can now look at the first objection to this ‚Ä¶‚Äô. Thus, the Body will bring forward your various arguments and your researched evidence.

What is the ‚ÄòArgument, Objection, Reply‚Äô (AOR) format? \
While your thesis is your main claim, you will need to make arguments. Well-argued essays generally will follow Graff & Birkenstein‚Äôs ‚ÄòThey Say/I Say‚Äô format which focuses on laying out arguments and analyses of others and then responding to them. In the case of our essay, we are suggesting a modified version of this. First, show the reader your main Argument (in support of your thesis): what are you arguing in order to prove your thesis and what is your evidence and support for this argument from your sources? Next, show the reader an Objection or Objections to your argument, again providing evidence that backs up the objection ‚Äì this is also called a ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô presentation of the objection(s) because you want to show the reader you understand and can present the objection properly, not sloppily or dismissively. Finally, Reply to the Objections: what do you argue to refute, oppose, disprove the Objections, based on evidence and sources. In all cases, you are using your sources to provide evidence to back up your arguments, objections and replies. In addition, the AOR format will ensure you show you can reason and understand your thesis with a number of supporting arguments, but also defend against reasoned and understood objections. This also creates a conversation flow to your essay, so the reader sees your arguments develop and will see if you can defend them against objections.

How many arguments do you need to support your thesis? Here it is important to stress we are looking for quality not quantity. For example, if you decide to make 6 arguments with objections and replies, your essay will have no depth and lack sources and evidence to support them ‚Äì an argument every 350 words. However, if you do 3 arguments, and their objections and replies, you are more likely to have depth ‚Äì evidence, examples, sources and quotes ‚Äì to support your thesis, and will do better on the essay.  Thus, do not aim for quantity of arguments but depth of arguments.

So, what makes a good Argument‚Äô? A good argument puts forward a reasonable point or claim that links to the thesis, then seeks to prove it with evidence, sources, quotes, examples, etc.  A good argument supports the thesis and is itself supported. Consequently, the good argument is reasonable, defensible and evidenced. It also follows the saying: ‚ÄúShow me, don‚Äôt tell me‚Äù; in other words, prove it with evidence and sources to persuade the reader, and do not rely on or demand the reader has to take your word for it (they will not as they are expecting you to do your job and prove your points).

So, what makes a good Objection and good Reply? In both cases, as with a Good Argument, you need to provide evidence and proof. As well, you need to provide ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô presentation of the Objection; this means present it properly with evidence, as if you were making that as your argument, and do not simply choose those parts of the Objection that are easy to shoot down because they are, in fact, an incomplete or incorrect or skewed presentation of the Objection. Give the Objection a reasonably positive or favourable presentation before your Reply ‚Äì critique, disprove or pull apart ‚Äì to the Objection. Once you have laid out the Objection, think of a strong Reply to the Objection, and make sure you provide evidence to back up your Reply. Again, as with the good Argument, choose quality over quantity, so you have depth to your analysis.

Also, don‚Äôt be shy: edit and be a ruthless editor. Pick only your strongest arguments to put forward, that is, arguments you can discuss and prove with depth, i.e. sources and evidence. Similarly, pick the best Objections and Reply to them. Avoid choosing ‚Äònovel‚Äô or ‚Äòunique‚Äô arguments for the sake of ‚Äòbeing different‚Äô; novelty without depth is not going to receive a good grade.

What is the Conclusion? \
The Conclusion ties together your essay. In it, you want to remind the reader of the question you responded to, your thesis, and a summary of your arguments, objections and replies. Never introduce new information, arguments, etc., that has not already been argued or discussed in the essay. In addition, based on what you have argued, you are welcome to suggest further research questions or ideas others can research or analyse.

Why do I need to Revise, Review or have a Friend look it over? \
Avoid submitting your first-and-only version of your essay. You need to learn to manage your time to research, to write, and give yourself time to edit. A great saying from one of prof‚Äôs: ‚ÄúWriting is easy; re-writing is hard‚Äù; editing means looking over your words, making sure you have selected the right words to make your points, or provided the best evidence to support your arguments, or ensuring your arguments prove your thesis, or making sure your spelling and grammar are not problematic or incorrect. One way to avoid a lot of errors: have a friend or someone else read it over because sometimes what you have written is not the same as what was in your mind or your choice of words does not make that point.  Many essays drop in overall grade because of careless errors and problems which make them difficult to read, flow or understand, and all that could have been avoided by taking a few minutes to edit the essay. As well, note that Clarity and Organization are important criteria in assessing your essay, so get someone to read over and critique your essay, so it is clearer and better argued.

Why I should cite from the my Sources? \
It is important to cite your ideas, quotations, etc., to show the reader you got those materials from Sources. The more you use your Sources in the essay and provide the citations, it is likely you will do better because the TA will see you have used all sources and have grappled with the issue in the different. When you cite, you are giving a clear indication to the reader your ideas are supported, backed or drawing on others who have made similar arguments or provide proof for your ideas. Similarly, for Objections and Replies, sources show you properly understand the other sides to the debate, that is, you did not just pull stuff out of the air.

How should I incorporate my Sources into my essay? \
There are many ways to do this. You can do the well-known ‚Äòquotation sandwich‚Äô: introduce the quote or quote‚Äôs author, then provide the quote, and then explain the point or connection of the quote to your argument. You can claim ‚ÄòAs Narain argues, ‚Ä¶‚Äù and paraphrase their point (don‚Äôt use some or part of their words; if you are using their words, then just quote them). You can provide your evidence or discuss your examples, etc., and then cite the source where it comes from. Again, all this will help the reader to know you did your research and have understood the necessary ideas, etc. As well, you will do better on your essay overall because you will have proven and supported your claims.

What is Plagiarism? \
If you pass off other people‚Äôs word, ideas, examples, etc., as your own in your essay, that will constitute plagiarism. Just as you do not want someone to steal your ideas, words, etc., do not steal those of others, either. The Course Outline, the Appendices, and various documents on UWO‚Äôs websites provide fuller details of the standards and possible punishments.

Can I bring in a draft to be read? \
While we will not be reading over drafts.

Any final advice? \
YES: Pick an Essay topic-question that you will enjoy doing ‚Äì if you have fun doing it, you will likely do better on it. If you have questions or concerns, please talk to Dan or Nig; we are always ready to help and guide you.

 Good luck! 


# How do I Do Research, Find Sources, Use the Library Resources, etc., to complete the EBO?


---


## **What and where are some Resources, Videos, etc.,  for these Assignments?**

Now that you have a sense of what your final product is, you'll need to begin how to go about researching. It's important that you review these resources before you begin working on your assignments. If you decide to jump into the assignment without fully reviewing this information, chances are, you'll make needless errors. The library has provided great resources that will be particularly helpful to prepare for this assignment.

### **Where is the Library website? How do I get Off-Campus Access to the Library and its Resources so I don't pay extra to get articles, newspapers, etc.?**

 **Western Libraries website: **[https://www.lib.uwo.ca/](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/)

***How do I get off-campus access from home, out of London/Ontario/Canada?*  \
**[Check out info here: https://www.lib.uwo.ca/offcampus/index.htm](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/offcampus/index.html)


### **Where are Links to Weldon Political Science Librarian Christy Sich's Research Help pages?**



* [Databases for articles (remember: still need to figure out the scholarly sources)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/politicalscience/corearticles)
* [Background Sources (not scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2187872)
* [UN & IGO sources (not scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2187872)
* [International News sources (not scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2212995)

### **What are Keywords?**

"Keywords, also commonly called search terms, are the words that you enter into the database search boxes. They represent the main concepts of your research topic and are the words used in everyday life to describe the topic. Without the right keywords, you may have difficulty finding the articles that you need.

Selecting keywords is a multi-step process that involve



* identifying the main concepts of your topic
* brainstorming synonyms and antonyms that could also be used to describe your topic
* spell out abbreviations

It is very rare that your first search will bring back perfect results. It takes trial and error to determine which keywords work best for your topic. Be prepared to run multiple searches in your quest for the keywords that will help you find the materials you need.


#### **Turn your topic into keywords**

When doing an internet search in Google or Bing, you can enter your complete research question in the search box and get a bunch of results. However, if you enter your entire research question in the Library databases, you probably won't get any results. This is because the library databases look for the exact words that you enter in the search box(es). If the database can't find all of the words that you entered in the search boxes in the information about an article, it won't bring back any results. That's why it's important to search only for the main parts of your topic.

Here is an example of a research question:

What is the relationship between test performance and the retention of ESL students?

The keywords for this topic are listed below:

test performance \
retention \
ESL students


### **Synonyms**

Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meaning. 

Some topics have many different terms that can be used to describe them. For example, here are some additional keywords that could be used for test performance: \
Tests      \
Exams      \
Test-Taking Skill \
Test Anxiety      \
Academic Achievement      \
Test Preparation

#### **Keywords can be 'horizontal' and 'vertical'**

Consider the topic of "Indigenous rights in the Pacific Rim" area. \
 

Horizontal: a synonym for "Pacific Rim" could be "New Zealand", "Australia", "Oceania"

Vertical: another approach might be to 'dig down' to focus more on what you want to explore, so "Australia" synonyms could be "Aborigines", "Queensland" (where most live), "Canberra" (the capital) [in this case, one would be writing a paper on Indigenous peoples of Australia]

### **How do I write a Search-String to get On-Topic Sources?**

Search strings are combining Keywords and Synonyms -- words you already have worked out based on your topic and question -- those words into a Search statement For examples, you were doing the topic Canada's role in global peacekeeping and decided you will look at one such mission in Haiti, so one could search: Canada and peacekeeping and Haiti . These are Keywords about the topic, and you could use some of the synonyms for a second search string: Canada and food aid and Caribbean (food aid = synonym for peacekeeping, and Caribbean = synonym for Haiti).

### **What is a Scholarly Source? How Can I Identify a Scholarly Source?**


### **What is the difference between Scholarly vs. Popular Sources?**

"**Scholarly vs. Popular Sources**

Definition

A scholarly publication is one in which the content is written by experts in a particular field of study - generally for the purpose of sharing original research or analyzing others' findings. Scholarly work will thoroughly cite all source materials used and is usually subject to "peer review" prior to publication. This means that independent experts in the field review, or "referee" the publication to check the accuracy and validity of its claims. The primary audience for this sort of work is fellow experts and students studying the field. As a result the content is typically much more sophisticated and advanced than articles found in general magazines, or professional/trade journals. \
 \
In brief, scholarly work is: \
- written by experts for experts \
- based on original research or intellectual inquiry \
- provides citations for all sources used \
- is usually peer reviewed[*] prior to publication‚Äù

Source: [https://guides.library.ubc.ca/EvaluatingSources/ScholarlyPopular](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/EvaluatingSources/ScholarlyPopular)

"**Scholarly Articles (Journals) \
**- Are written by and for faculty, researchers or scholars (chemists, historians, doctors, artists, etc.) \
- Uses scholarly or technical language \
- Tend to be longer articles about research \
- Include full citations for sources  \
- Are often refereed or peer reviewed (articles are reviewed by an editor and other specialists before being accepted for publication) \
- Book reviews and editorials are not considered scholarly articles, even when found in scholarly journals"

"Some points to remember: 



* Both magazine and journal articles can be good sources for your work.
* When selecting articles, think about how you intend to use the information: 
    * Do you want background on a topic new to you? (use magazines)  
    * Did your teacher say to cite scholarly resources? (use journals)
* Often a combination of the two will be most appropriate for undergraduate research. "

### **How do I Search for Scholarly Sources through Weldon's Website? (don't use Google Scholar)**


### **Why not use Google Scholar?**



* You will be charged big $$ for articles and books access
* **You already paid big $$ for access to a lot more and better sources through your Tuition**
* You will **only see random 3-5 pages** from a source and this will become obvious to any marker
* It decides sources based on a marketing algorithm (that's where marketing decides what you should see), while Weldon is seeking the best resources for research (that's where Librarians are tweaking the search engine to get you good stuff so you do well on your essay)
* Some sources are NOT Scholarly -- you cannot use the claim 'Google Scholar said it was' when your sources get discounted
* Still, you can use Google Scholar to search <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in addition to</span> Weldon if you so decide, BUT check with Weldon's site for free access to the same sources.


### **Nig's How-To-Video for Searching for Academic Articles**

***This is My Video showing you how to Search for Scholarly Articles through the Western Libraries' website* **

**Remember: your Tuition has given you access to this fantastic Librarians-created Search Engine. You will NOT find better materials through Google, and unless you want to blow $30-$100 bucks per article access or try to figure out what's in a 200-page book or 20-page article by reading 3-random pages selected by Google (recipe for failure), then you really should use the Library's system AND get HELP from Librarians!**

**Note:**



* **[Weldon's new FRONT SEARCH page is here](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/index.html) and it is slightly different than the one in this older video, BUT while there will be some differences from this video, the general instructions and suggestions can still be followed by just looking around for similar links, modifiers, etc.**

### **How do I Cite in MLA 9th edition and in Chicago 17th edition Styles?**


#### **DON'T USE APA or any of the other 300+ styles.**


#### **IMPORTANT NOTES:**



* Citations and Bibliography/Works Cited are two different parts of the Essay
* Bibliography is your Sources -- articles, book chapters, etc. -- in your Essay and is at *end of your Essay* (MLA or Chicago) after the text (arguments, etc.) of your Essay
* Citations are you references to your Sources *inside your Essay*, and if they are in-line bracket references (MLA) or footnotes (Chicago), they are i the inside text-page of your Essay, however, if they are endnotes (Chicago) then they go after the text of your Essay but before your Bibliography/Works Cited
* You MUST pick ONLY ONE of either MLA Style or Chicago Style -- don't mix!
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ALWAYS include the page numbers</span> for where you got your information, etc.

# What are the Instructions for the Essay?


---


### **What is the Essay?**

Political Science 1026 is an Essay course, so you must research, write and submit a 1500-word Final Essay.  The Essay is an Argumentative essay with Arguments, Objections and Replies. It should have a Thesis, or central argument/claim, 2-3  major arguments in support of the Thesis and supported with evidence and sources. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Outline and will receive comments and a grade.


### **What is the Length of the Final Essay?**

The Essay should be **1500 words**. The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">maximum</span> is 1650 words (basically 10% over). The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">minimum</span> permissible length 1350 words (basically 10% under). Below 1350 or over 1650 at the discretion of the Professors, will receive a penalty of -5% and will definitely be downgraded.

**NOTE: Essays less than 1000 words will receive a maximum grade of 48%/F+, otherwise less.**


### **How should I write the Essay?**

**Read the ‚ÄúHow should I approach Writing my Poli Sci 1026 Essay?‚Äù document** on the Class OWL site. This document explains how to write an argumentative essay and you are responsible for knowing what is written in that document AND for following through in writing your essay accordingly.


### **What are the Essay Topics?**



1. Why are youth in North America and/or Western Europe not participating in formal politics (e.g. voting, political parties, and campaigns)? Compare 2 countries.
2. On balance, has globalization‚Äôs impact been positive or negative? Compare the case of 2 countries.
3. Should nuclear weapons be banned?
4. Are global pandemics best managed by international cooperation or by states acting on their own?
5. Is the American War on Terror a failure?
6. Should Canada be accepting more refugees?

NOTE: write your Essay in relation to the current time period, so for example, don‚Äôt write about the American War of Independence as ‚Äòsecession‚Äô from England in 1770s


### **How many Academic Scholarly Articles and Books should I use in the Final Essay?**

As many as will help you make your arguments strong, evidenced, cited and proven, as well as opposing argument credibly presented and refuted. Still, you need to have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">used at least 7</span> academic scholarly articles and/or scholarly book. If you don‚Äôt have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">at least 7 academic/scholarly sources used</span> in your Essay, a penalty of -5% will also be applied. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Bibliography, and will receive a grade and feedback/comments.


### **How should I format the Essaay?**

Your Essay should be in 12-point Arial or Helvetica or Verdana or Calibri (avoid Times or Bookman, if possible, but no grades are lost for using a Serif font) font and should be double-spaced and left-justified.

Generally, please format using 1‚Äù margins, so your essay will be about 5-6 pages. Bibliography/Works Cited go at the end of the essay. Note that we use Word Count so squeezing or expanding your margins serves no useful purpose at all.

NO subheadings; learn to use Transitions between paragraphs and major sections.


### **How are you grading my essay?**

Your essay will be graded according to the following criteria:



1. **Reasoning:**
    * Do you have a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">clear thesis</span>? (your <span style="text-decoration:underline;">main claim</span> in response to the question)
    * Have you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">developed arguments</span> to support your thesis?
    * Have you selected <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reasonable objections</span>?

While these are 4 key areas, each one is part of holistic assessment.


### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">When do I cite information?</span>**

Cite anything that is an idea or evidence from your sources. Definitely cite any quoted information ‚Äì that is, you are using the exact same words as your source. Remember: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">changing words is not sufficient</span> to not require you to use quotes and cite the source! (It can also be plagiarism.) Thus, cite the source and page number <span style="text-decoration:underline;">every time</span> you directly quote a source OR when you paraphrase an idea from a source OR when a particular idea or piece of information comes from the source (even when you don‚Äôt quote it directly).

Essays without footnotes/endnotes or in-line bracket citation will receive a ‚Äì10% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).


### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do I have to provide a Bibliography or Works Cited?</span>**

You must include a Bibliography (Chicago) or Works Cited (MLA) identifying, in alphabetical order by surname, the readings you used in writing your essay. If you divide up your sources by source type (book or article), that is okay, although, technically not correct but you won‚Äôt lose marks.

If you do not provide a bibliography, you will receive a ‚Äì10% penalty.

10. Do I have to have a clear thesis to do well on this Essay?
    * Yes

 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Introduction</span>**



1. Does my Introduction para have to have the Essay Question?
    * Yes,
    * Will ensure you actually *respond* to the question
    * Should state question before you start your thesis
    * Can state passively as well:
        * Active: "Is a federal system of state or a unitary form of state better?
        * Passive: There is debate about whether a federal state or a unitary state is a better form of state. 
2. Can I use "I" as in "I would argue", etc.?
    * Yes.
    * Personal pronouns are permitted; BUT be careful to write arguments, e.g. "I argue", "I assert", "I claim", and NOT feelings, e.g. "I feel", "I believe", "I love", "I hate" -- those later words often lead to moving away from evidence and arguments into unprovable and untenable areas
3. Can I say 'This essay argues...', 'My argument is that...', 'The position taken here is...' instead of "I ..."
    * Yes, those are all fine as long you are focussing on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">arguing</span>, asserting, and making claims (not 'I feel that' or 'it shook me to see')
4.  Does my Introduction para have to my Thesis stated?
    * Yes
    * State clearly your position in response to the question, and *ensure you are answering the essay question*
    * Thesis can be a simple: "I argue nuclear weapons should be banned"
    * Thesis can be complex: "This essay asserts nuclear should not be banned because ..."
5. Can I change sides in my thesis?
    * Yes
    * Welcome to change sides from what you asserted in the EO
6. Does my Introduction para need to have my 2/3 arguments stated?
    * Yes
    * May attach them to the thesis, .e.g. "This essay asserts nuclear should not be banned because ..."
    * May be their own separate sentences *after* thesis
    * Should *not* be longer than a sentence for each one, but short statement of each is just as fine
7. Does my Introduction need to have my Objections and Replies?
    * No
    * Not necessary but also fine if you choose to do so
    * Avoid writing lengthy write-up of these in the Introduction
8. Should I state my Case Studies?
    * If they are required as part of your question, you should state them in the Introduction para
9. Does my Introduction have to be just one para?
    * Yes
    * Don‚Äôt waste words with excessive background, lay-up, etc. ‚Äì you can do this in a para *after *the Intro 1<sup>st</sup> para
10. May I write 2-3 Introduction paras?
    * No
11. If I want to provide background and definitions, may I put them in a separate para?
    * Yes, put them after yoru Introduction para
    * *Avoid* a very long or extensive background/definition para


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Argument-Objection-Reply</span>**



1. Can I change my arguments as I do more research?
    * Yes!
    * Improve your sources, get better research and make better arguments
2. Do I need to follow the A-O-R structure for the Essay?
    * Yes
    * Ensures you make and evidence an Argument, explain and explore the Objections, and provide a thoughtful Reply
3. For the essay, we are asked to provide and Argument - Objection - Reply format. Would these three be one paragraph or is it okay to divide them into three different paragraphs? 
    * These *should be in more than one paragraph *-- indeed many paragraphs!
    * Argument should be longer than Objection; Objection should be longer than Reply
    * Give DEPTH to your argument as well
    * One structure you may consider: 
        * Argument: 2 paras, 1 for argument, 1 for evidence(s) for the argument
        * Objection: 2 paras, 1 for objection, 1 for evidence(s) for the objection
        * Rebuttal: 1 para for countering the objection
4. Do I have to address the questions theoretically or can I focus on the just arguments? 
    * Don't try to tackle theory, unless you truly want to and will work to understand the relevant theory properly
    * Focus on your arguments, providing evidence for them, and ensuring you have citations from sources 
5. Can I make more than 3 main arguments to support the thesis?
    * No
    * It's like a good date: 3 good date events/things are better than 10 events packed in and no time for depth of experience
6. Can I just write about one case study as my argument(s) or thesis?
    * NO
    * A case study or example is NOT an argument
    * Also, better to compare two cases with depth, than touch-n-go a bunch of cases
    * Put forward arguments, and then your case study or examples <span style="text-decoration:underline;">back up *that *argument</span>
    * Imagine if you were asked the question, "what is vegetable as compared to a fruit?" and the answer I gave you was "Broccoli is a vegetable which is a Cabbage and has a Head shape"; while that tells me about broccoli, I would have to guess (wrongly) that all vegetables are cabbage and head-shaped, but that's not true for all vegetables; indeed, it would be better to make an argument for what is a fruit, and then how the rest are vegetables (and many fruits are used as vegetables in cooking, such as tomatoes)
    * So, use the example or case study to prove an argument BUT don't claim the example is the argument
    * ALSO, you can also state in the introduction that you are primarily focusing on a case or example, but note that only using one case or example leaves your argument open to critique that you have only one supporting case example; so better to dig into the one case BUT ALSO draw on some other examples as well (even if just a little bit to show another example to bolster your arguments and essay overall)
7. How should I use my cases?
    * You may use one case for your argument, the other for the counter
    * You may use one case to provide for your argument and its counter-argument
    * You may examine both cases in each of your arguments BUT be cautious that you still have sufficient examination of the cases
8. Can I re-use my EO text word-for-word (copy-and-paste) into my essay for my arguments, etc.?
    * Yes
    * It's not self-plagiarism; it would be *if you submitted the essay* and then use from your own submitted essay in a paper next year or in another class


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span>**



1. Should my Conclusion have the Question, Thesis, and a summary of my arguments, objections and replies?
    * Yes, and this would be in the past tense as you‚Äôve ‚Äòdone‚Äô all this in the Essay
2. Should I introduce new arguments or evidence?
    * No
3. May I point to implications of my arguments?
    * Yes 
4. May I point to other questions, queries, research, etc., which could be done by someone else?
    * No

 


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sources: Evidence</span>**



1. In addition to Scholarly Academic sources, may I use non-academic sources such as magazines, website, policy briefs, working papers, etc.
    * Yes but try to find academic sources for the same info if possible
    * If you need current statistics, policies, etc., these can be useful but avoid over-reliance (or only source) on them for data, etc.
    * Remember to check that their info is valid; for example, in 2003, many newspapers, magazines, etc., reported Iraq had nuclear weapons, but late 2003, they were printing retractions and corrections to this information
    * Avoid blogs, op-eds, etc.
    * Government sources are also fine
    * NOTE: pay attention to citation styles for websites as that is done differently than for scholarly articles or scholarly books
        * FYI: scholarly articles from websites *cannot *be cited as website but must be properly cited as scholarly articles AND same applies for e-books
2. Can I use sources from 2010 and earlier?
    * Yes but try to use more contemporary/newer sources, closer to the current time/last decade
    * If you use old sources, *acknowledge* they are old and why you used them, e.g, As Ching-Mei, writing in 1999 just following India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests, notes China's response was ... (Ching-Mei, 529)
3. How do I show the Marker I actually *used a source* in my Essay?
    * Quote from it
    * Paraphrasing forn it
    * Drawsome information from it like statistic
    * Indicating the source generally supports or alludes to a claim you are making
    * Reminder:  you need to provide citations for any/each of the aforementioned
4. How many academic sources minimum should I have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">used</span> in my Essay?
    * 7 is the minimum, and that means you drew on the 7 academic sources and cited them
    * A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">minimum is *not* sufficient to do well or great</span>
    * More than 7 will likely mean you'll do better and provide better support, evidence, arguments, analysis
5. Will I do better if I use more than 7 academic sources in my Essay?
    * Yes
    * To do well, you'll need to *use* more than 7 academic sources
    * Historically, those who use predominantly, if not all, academic sources, and more than 7, write the best essays
6. Can I change my sources from the ones I used in my EBRA as I do more research?
    * Yes!
    * Improve your academic scholarly sources and get better research = better analysis & data = better arguments and essay
    * Note: changing sources does not always mean 'better' so make sure you don't mistakenly get rid of good sources
7. Do I have to have certain mix of scholarly sources?
    * No; you can use books or articles as you see fit
    * Reminder: non-scholarly sources are fine, but you need to be largely using scholarly sources
8. Do I have to use <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all or most</span> the sources for the topic on which I am writing?
    * Yes, please use all or most the sources; BUT they don‚Äôt have to be used equally
    * You may end up focussing on 6 or 7, but figure out how to substantively incorporate the other sources as well even if just for some stats, to back up further an argument from another source, or use it only for an objection to one or both of your arguments.
9. Can I use graphs, figures, and charts?
    * Yes *BUT* ensure you reference them and don't just plop them into your essay without context or connection, e.g. you have a graph of youth voting trends, you'd write something like 'As seen in Chart 2, the overall pattern since 1990 in Canada has been ...' (Stats Can)
    * If it's from a book or article, both Chicago and MLA require page numbers for 
10. Can I use personal examples? 
    * Not as evidence or proof
    * We cannot check or verify your personal example, circumstance or situation, so we cannot confirm what you are claiming about your experience as evidence or proof of a point. It is one thing to say, "I was walking late at night and thinking about the comment someone made to me that made me think about whether there is a right to free speech" versus "I was walking late at night with friends, and some rando yelled something nasty at us; but me and my five friends agreed that in Canada they had a right to free speech even if we were insulted, so that proves there is right to free speech as me and my friends all agreed" -- this second sentence is long and rambling, and most importantly, it is not proof or support either
    * This includes: stories about your life or those of others or fictionalized accounts
    * You need *ethics approval* to quote a person with whom you have spoken/interviewed/etc., so this is a huge problem if you don't follow the U's rule on interviewing rules, protocols, etc.
11. Can I use anecdotes, family stories, conversations with my friends, or examples from my personal experiences <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as evidence or proof</span>? 
    * NO. At best, they can be a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">short</span> hook or attention-catcher to pique the reader's interest in the Intro, BUT they are NOT themselves arguments or evidence
    * You need *ethics approval* to quote a person with whom you have spoken/interviewed/etc., so this is a huge problem if you don't follow the U's rule on interviewing rules, protocols, etc.
12. May I use the Textbook for BACKGROUND or IDEA information? 
    * ONLY in a LIMITED and MINIMAL WAY
    * You can cite a particular idea to from the textbooks but <span style="text-decoration:underline;">don't</span> use the textbook as evidence, e.g. cite Wolff IPP explaining Mill on the 'harm principle' but don't use Wolff's evidence/example/arguments/objections/etc.
13. Can I use a TED Talk, YouTube video, etc.?
    * *Not recommended*
    * A Ted Talk or reasonable YouTube video, etc., (not an unreasonable video source( would be treated like any other non-scholarly source
    * Often, the TED presenters have book, etc. to which you can look for the info and points they are discussing so recommend finding a written record of their points if possible
    * Technically you need to have a transcript, and you need to cite the timestamp (start and finish) for the source, and a narrower time stamp for a quote or paraphrase
    * Ensure you provide all the relevant info as per MLA or Chicago style (author, title, name of conference/convenor, URL, etc.
    * Again, TED talks are broad discussions, usually with one or two examples or anecdotes, so you don't get the full detailed account as you would from a written piece
14. May I cite Lectures?
    * No
15. May I use or cite a tutorial's Discussions or my TA comments? 
    * NO.


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sources: Citations</span>**



1. Do I have to provide page numbers for articles? 
    * Yes
    * Both Chicago and MLA require page numbers
2. Do ALL scholarly sources need page #s in the citations?
    * YES
    * Always provide page numbers for your citations of scholarly sources
    * Both Chicago and MLA require page numbers
3. Do I cite at the level of sentences not paragraphs? What if it is all from the same source?
    * Cite <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always at the level of the sentence</span>, even if it's the same source 3 sentences in a row, etc.
    * Do not do one citation set at the end of a paragraph as that will not be clear as to what you are citing and where in that para (quote? paraphrase? idea referenced?)
4. Do I have to provide page numbers for chapters from edited books/e-books? 
    * IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, you should provide page #s *for the chapter only*
    * Example in MLA style:  Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe".* Psychoanalysis and the Global.* Ed. Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
5. What if something does not have proper page numbers on the document, what should I do to cite?
    * Articles all have page numbers, so you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">have to do a little digging</span> to find the page numbers
    * You need to provide page numbers for all your articles, e.g. 725-73
6. If I‚Äôm quoting a source that is inside another source, do I have to cite the original source or the source I got it from?
    * The source *you got it from*, e.g. Beier had argued that ‚Äúthe TRC has ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Biswas-Mellamphy, 52) = this tells the reader you got the Beier quote from the Biswas-Mellamphy source
        * It would be dishonest to say you read the original source when you did not
        * It would be protective, in case the source you got it from got their other source‚Äôs quote, info, etc. wrong, you‚Äôd not be in trouble for that
7. What if I have multiple citations for the same sentence?
    * The all go in the same citation but separate them with a semi-colon:
        * MLA: (Jones, 52; Morrison, 355; Westmacott, 1789)
        * Chicago: 1. Jones, 52; Morrison, 355; Westmacott, 1789.
8. Do I have to divide up my sources in my Essay by source type like I did my EBO? Will I lose marks in my Essay dividing my sources by type like in my EBO?
    * No, but you should avoid this
    * Bibliographies/Works Cited should be single alphabetized list of sources
    * If you do divide them up, you won‚Äôt be downgraded (don‚Äôt do this in next year‚Äôs classes!)
    * You will be downgraded for not alphabetizing, indenting, missing publication information, etc., for a proper citation
9. Does the Bibliography or Works Cited count in the Word Count?
    * No
10. What Word Count leeway is given for the Works Cited or Bibliography
    * Take approx. 300 words off your Word Count = one page single-spaced approximately &lt; depends on the number of sources you have in your WC or Bibliography (if you only have 2 sources, that's like no more than 30-40 words)
11. Do MLA in-line/bracket Citations count for the Word Count? 
    * No
    * So, this will likely be about max. 200 words as well (8 pages with average 8 citations per page)
    * NOTE: If you are using Footnotes/Endnotes, TURN OFF the counting of Footnotes/Endnotes in your Word Count
12. Does word count matter more than # of pages?
    * Yes
    * Word count is what we assess so ensure you are meeting the word count minimums
    * # of pages can be affected by font size, margins, spacing, and other factors 
13. How many marks do I lose if I am over or under the word limit? 
    * *DISREGARD Essay document's 3200-2900 range statement*
    * Aim to come close to the 1500 word count
    * We are permitting:
        * below 1350 words = -5% penalty
        * above 1650 words = -5%
    * This is means a leeway of 150-words under/over (or 10% word count leeway) with no penalty, but anything more gets a penalty most likely
    * We do exercise discretion and best efforts in assessing this penalty
14. What can I do if I‚Äôm still short of the word count?
    * Evidence, examples with citations
    * Most essays who are low/below word count also <span style="text-decoration:underline;">usually have no to poor evidence</span> cited from sources, so read like an opinion-piece rather than an argumentative essay
15. What can I do if I‚Äôm over the word count?
    * Trim passive sentences, long quotes, repetitive sentences, unnecessarily excessive replicated verbiage
        * E.g. ‚Äòunnecessarily excessive replicated verbiage‚Äô could be replaced with ‚Äòrepeated big words‚Äô ‚Äì which also makes the point clearer
    * Remove adverbs, adjectives, etc., that are don‚Äôt add anything, e.g. ‚Äòthere are many reasons for this as it is involving‚Äô = ‚Äòthe reasons for this include‚Äô
16. Can I use headings & sub-headings? 
    * NO
    * If you *initially *use them to organize the essay, then do *delete them* before you submit your final copy
    * When you start your essay you may organize it by using some headings & sub-headings *BUT* you must <span style="text-decoration:underline;">remove</span> them before submitting your final copy
    * Replace the headings with Transitions, as discussed in the "How To Write..." document 
    * Here is a list of various Transition words: [https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/)
17. Do I have to check the Citation listing when I copy it from the Library Citation generator, ezBib, etc.?
    * Yes.
    * Check to make sure the name of the journal and the page numbers are there in particular, as these two tend to be the info often missing when there is an error in auto-generators 
18. If I'm using MLA Works Cited, may I still list my sources I referenced/read even though I did not actually cite them in the Essay?
    * Yes, that's fine
    * For our purposes, we are allow Works Cited to be more like Chicago's Bibliography model (which does not require all sources to have been cited in the essay text)
19. Should I provide both inline bracket citations MLA citations and footnotes/endnotes Chicago citations?
    * NO!
    * Use only 1/one citation style (also affects your Works Cited and Bibliography style, which should match the style you are using)
    * Use inline bracket citation OR footnotes OR endnotes -- don't use more than 1/one style!


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Formatting & Organization</span>**



1. Should I make time to edit?
    * **Yes**
    * Aim to be clear and succinct your writing, as expanding interconnected sentences and complexifying language choices just obfuscate from your intended argumentation (see what I did there: should've edited that ...)
    * Choose clarity: an essay is likely to do better if the reader TA-marker can understand what you are arguing, etc. -- indeed grade on essay (more) is correlated to the inverse of time taken to get through it (less
2. How do I make sense of the Draft Checker's results, i.e. how do I interpret them?
    * Generally, you want LESS THAN 15% OVERALL match
    * If you have a whole bunch 3%'s or less adding up to a large number, that's not an issue
    * Generally, you want NO SINGLE SOURCE to be over 3% but definitely beyond 5% is an issue
    * You can check your Word Count either in Document Viewer by clicking the "Circled-i" in the bottom left; or in top mast head under Text-only View
    * Bibliography and Quoted materials (if properly in quotes, but not bloc quotes) have been excluded
3. Do I need a separate title page?
    * No but you are welcome to have one
    * For either Chicago or MLA you can do so but not required
4. What information is recommended I put at the top of my first page or on a title page?
    * Your Name
    * Your TAs Name
    * Put Prof's name (one or both of us)
    * Title of your Essay -- can be as simple as "Free Speech" or complex like "TikBallot? InstaVote? Countering Declining Youth Participation in Formal Politics in North America"
    * Citation Style (either MLA or Chicago)
    * As this is an electronic submission via OWL, so while we have info 1-3 known to us but it's good to get in the habit of writing a formal top page or title page


#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Submission</span>**



1. Is there a particular file-name format I have to use?
    * No
    * Use only alphabet letters, numbers, dashes/'-'

    * No submissions after the link is closed
14. What if the link closes as I'm submitting?
    * If you are uploading, and OWL is uploading your file, but it rolls past the deadline, it will just show as "Late" BUT *that Late* indicates OWL did upload it so you're good and won't be penalized as late
15. What do I do if I missed the on-time submission deadline and the link is closed?

    * No
    * You can pick two countries from North America, the Global South, Western Africa, etc.

##### **Late Updated: Nov 8**

*(Note that some of the direction it's giving is not fully nuanced or correct, so it's your responsibility to review all the information posted on the OWL site to confirm the AI gave you correct information and correct it yourself, and even the AI Bot always cautions: "There may be errors in my responses; always refer to the course web page.")*

ALSO, topic-specific questions are answer on the Essay-FAQ page, while more general EBO questions are discussed below.

Highly recommend you talk to your TA.



1. Should I read the Essay pages and watch all the Videos on how to do Research?
    * Yes
    * Then, contact your TA to get any questions answered
        * You can also email me BUT you should be talking/chatting with your TAs
2. Is this an annotated bibliography?
    * No
    * Nowhere is it stated that it it an annotated bibliography, so *don't invent requirements *(or mislead others, thanks)
    * If you did end up writing one, we will simply disregard it AND you still must meet all other requirements for this assignment
3. Can I change my sources as I do more research?
    * Yes!
    * Improve your sources and get better research
4. Can I change my Essay topic from what I write about in my EBO? \

    * If you change your essay's topic-question from what you wrote for the EBO, you will get 0/zero for the EBO retroactively, i.e. lose the EBO grade = 0% but still get your full Essay grade
5. What if something does not have proper page numbers on the document?
    * Articles all have page numbers, so you have to do a little digging to find the page numbers
    * You need to provide page numbers for all your articles, e.g. 725-738
6. Do I have to do one of the topics listed in the Essay Assignment?
    * Yes
    * Picking your own topic will result in a 0/zero being assigned and zero/0 for your grade for the EBO and/or Essay
7. Do I just need only 4 book/ebook sources in total for full marks?
    * No: a minimum is exactly that *a minimum*
    *  4 = 2.5/passing grade SO: 5 = 3, 6 = 4,  7+ = 5
    * If you have less than 4, you will get less/lower marks
8. Do I just need only 7 article sources in total for full marks?
    * No: a minimum is exactly that *a minimum*
    *  7 = 2.5/passing grade SO: 8 = 3, 9 = 4,  10+ = 5
    * If you have less than 7, you will get less/lower marks
9. How do I come up with keywords?
    * Watch the video links posted and check out the Powerpoint.
    * Your keywords should come from the topic and you'll have to work through what you want to focus on, etc.
    * Your keywords must be relevant to the topic and not generalities, etc., that would gives us a relevant result 
    * For example, if the topic was War Crimes and Yugoslavia,
        * Your keywords & synonyms could be:
            * war crimes > genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity
            * International Criminal Court > UN, Security Council, The Hague
            * Yugoslavia > Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia
10. Do I have to provide pages for Books or eBooks in the EBO?
    * Not if it's a monograph: "A monograph is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to reference works) on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author, and usually on a scholarly subject."
    * E.g. Narain, Nigmendra. *Friendly Arms, Killing Enemies: Building Oversees Organizational Kabals. *Western University Press, 2020. &lt; you only list the book, not the pages you plan to use, the particular chapters you want to use, etc.
    * IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, then: yes (see below)
11. Do I have to provide page numbers for chapters from edited books e-books? 
    * IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, you should provide page #s
    * Example in MLA style:  Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe".* Psychoanalysis and the Global.* Edited and with an Introduction by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
12. Do I have to provide page numbers for articles? 
    * Yes
    * Example in MLA style: Bousfield, Dan. ‚ÄúRevisiting Cyber-Diplomacy: Canada‚ÄìChina Relations Online.‚Äù *Globalizations*, vol. 14, no. 6, Aug. 2017, pp. 1045‚Äì59, doi:10.1080/14747731.2017.1362176.
13. Do I have to check the Citation listing when I copy it from the Library Citation generator, ezBib, etc.?
    * YES ABSOLUTELY!
    * Check to make sure the name of the journal and the page numbers are there in particular, as these two tend to be the info often missing when there is an error in auto-generators 
14. Can I list sources from 2009 and earlier?
    * We are looking for sources published/written from 2010 onwards
    * If you use sources from 2009 or older, we just won't count them towards your total number of sources
15. Do I have to provide DOIs and URLs?
    * Not required but can include if you want to, and no marks take off/gained for having them
    * However: if it is strictly a website page (like the UN.org or irpp.org page), a web-report (as in there is no PDF of the UN's report), etc., then you would need the URL BUT note this is *not *the type of sources you want in the EBO, as the EBO is about scholarly, academic sources *which *happen to be on & accessed through multiple portal websites (Weldon's system, JSTOR, Ebsco, etc.)
16. After I get my EBO back, can I change my argument, counter-argument, rebuttal, examples/case studies, sources, as I do more research?
    * Yes!
    * Improve your sources and get better research > use the new sources in your essay, and you can replace the sources from your EBO if they no longer are as useful
    * Make better or different arguments, counter-arguments, rebuttals as you work through your research, so do improve and change as needed
    * Change your examples or case studies so you have a better fit with/evidence for your arguments, etc.
17. Is the thesis one sentence only ?
    * Yes
    * One sentence AND your supporting arguments can be put come afterwards (second, third, etc., sentences)
    * If you want to add some nuance or parameters that are reasonable, that is okay: 'I argue globalization has been positive in terms economic globalization' or ''This essay argues nuclear weapons should not be banned for states but should be banned non-state actors'
    * Your thesis is your main claim or position in response to the question your essay is addressing, so it is the main point or goal or purpose you are going to defend with arguments and evidence
    * You should state your thesis as a single sentence, such as ‚ÄúI argue ‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs policy on gambling should be ‚Ä¶‚Äù
    * If you have reasons or arguments in support of this position, you should put those in the next sentence or sentences
    * Don't provide your counter-arguments in the thesis, but you can provide in your Introduction para
    * Don't provide any rebuttals in the thesis or Introductory para
    * Also, what you argue is up to you as long as your thesis is reasonable and can be supported by the evidence in the sources 
    * If you want to open with a 'hook' or 'teaser' statement before rolling into your thesis, etc., that's fine <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but</span> save that for your Essay, e.g. "If not for globalization, would we have our computers, watches, phones and the Good LIfe? However, globalization created for those who produce the electronics and other stuff we consume a life that is barely life, much less a 'good life'. In this essay, I argue ..."
18. Does my thesis only have to be a response to the question?
    * It is clearest if you simply state your thesis as a response: 'I argue that the state should put limits on free speech' or 'This essay argues the American War on Terror has failed'
19. Can I make more than 3 main arguments to support the thesis?
    * No, please don't
    * Aim for depth: make you main argument supported by strong arguments, evidence, etc., *which *needs you to have depth in your arguments
    * It's like a good date: 2-3 good date events/things/places are better than 10 events packed in and no time for depth of experience, i.e. no time with the other person/persons
20. How many sentences per argument/opposing/rebuttal?
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">3-5 sentences is fine per each</span>
        * Argument: 3-5 sentences
        * Counter-argument: 3-5 sentences
        * Rebuttal: 3-5 sentences
        * DON'T dump an entire paragraph or paragraphs for each
        * *Goal: tell the reader what your arguing and why *
    * 5 sentences is a maximum
21. Can I use bullet-points for the AOR part of the Essay Outline
    * Bullet-points are ok **IF** you write sentences and provide proper and necessary information
    * Best to follow the same as the sentences point above: 3-5 bullet points
22. Do I need to provide sources, citations or bibliography for the Essay Outline?
    * No
    * If you do, that's fine but we won't add or take away from your grade for this
23. May I include my arguments or an elaboration?
    * It is preferable not include them in the thesis but to provide them in the sentences which follow
    * However, some topics may actually be better served by doing so (so it's your call in that case), such as 'I argue Western European youth are not participating in formal politics because elections are not live-streamed on Twitch and TikTok partying features only EDM dub-step parties not political parties"
24. Do I have to use 'I'? Can I say 'This essay argues...', 'My argument is that...', 'The position taken here is...'
    * Yes, those are all fine as long you are focussing on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">arguing</span>, asserting, and making claims (not 'I feel that' or 'it shook me to see')
25. If I have found other sources, etc., so do I need to re-submit the EBO? Do I need to check the new sources with my TA?
    * No
    * You should always be on look for better and more useful sources
    * You don't need to check them with your TA but make sure you're using academic sources 
26. Do I have to provide examples or case studies?
    * If your question is asking you focus on case studies, then it would be good to mention your selections are part of your argument or counter-argument
    * If it's just some general example you want to mention to get advice, etc., that's fie
    * Not required but can be helpful
27. Can I change my examples or case studies,
    * Yes, BUT if your essay question has specific guidelines (e.g. Western Europe), then your case studies must still conform to that requirements
28. What if I catch a last minute error so can I resubmit?
    * You can <span style="text-decoration:underline;">but</span> ONLY UNTIL the deadline can you resubmit a corrected version > it will override your old submission with the new one ONLY if submitted by the deadline time
    * No submissions after the link is closed
29. What if the link closes as I'm submitting?
    * If you are uploading, and OWL is uploading your file, but it rolls past the deadline, it will just show as "Late" BUT *that Late* indicates OWL did upload it so you're good and won't be penalized as late
30. What do I do if I missed the on-time submission deadline and the link is closed?
    * It's late SO keep working on it and then submit at the next available deadline
31. What do I do if I missed the late submission deadline and the link is closed?
    * Unless you have accommodation, you will NOT be permitted to submit the assignment and will receive 0
32. What is the difference between a Book and an Edited book?
    * A Book is also called a Monograph with one author (or could be many authors) and each chapter is written by that author, not multiple authors
        * E.g.: Whitworth, Sandra. *Feminism and International Relations‚ÄØ: Towards a Political Economy of Gender in Interstate and Non-Governmental Institutions.* St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1994.
    * An Edited Book has chapter-articles which are written by various authors, so each chapter has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the author of each</span> chapter listed in the table of contents, so in your EBO, you'd list each chapter-article separately with its author, e.g.:
        * Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". *Psychoanalysis and the Global. *Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
        * Sioh, Maureen, Dan‚ÄúThe Logic of Humiliation in Financial Conquest.‚Äù *Psychoanalysis and the Global*. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 44-60.
33. Can I list each chapter of a monograph Book as separate EBO listings?
    * NO
    * So for Whitworth, Sandra. *Feminism and International Relations‚ÄØ: Towards a Political Economy of Gender in Interstate and Non-Governmental Institutions * , you can't list each of its chapters
34. How many chapter-articles can I use from any one Edited Book?
    * You can use 2 chapter-articles from the same book
    * NOTE: the Edited book listed full itself will only count for 1 and cannot be considered a separate listing, so if you listed these 3 below, only 2 would count (the full book listing is #2 below):
        * Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". *Psychoanalysis and the Global. *Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
        * Kapoor, Ilan, ed. *Psychoanalysis and the Global*. University of Nebraska Press, 2018.
        * Sioh, Maureen, Dan‚ÄúThe Logic of Humiliation in Financial Conquest.‚Äù *Psychoanalysis and the Global*. Edited by Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 44-60.
35. Is there a significant difference between MLA 8 vs MLA 9?
    * No
    * Librarians confirmed the types of sources we are asking for in the EBO and Essay are no affected by the differences between MLA 8 vs. MLA 9


# EBO: File & Comments access


---


# **EBO: File & Comments access**

Your EBO Gradesheet and EBO GRADE are posted in the Gradebook. The EBO GradeSheet is *not* a separate document like the one posted on the EBO instructions page; due to the Brightspaces system configuration, you'll see the EBO Gradesheet in the Gradebook with all the same criteria, numerical assessments, quality/text assessments, etc. I'll be emaling you a OneDriveSharepoint link for you to access your EBO file (see more info below) today and tomorrow, but if you don't get a link by Friday, do let me know.

Your marked EBO will be made **available by an Sharepoint Online email link sent directly to you **for you to access your EBO file via UWO's OneDrive system (not your personal or other organizational accounts). You will need to go into that linked-folder and drill down, and then you'll find: comments made into your submitted Word file using the Comment bubbles or typed into the file, possibly at the bottom; **OR** comments into your submitted PDF file using Comments bubbles or Text boxes; **OR** a separate Word or PDF or text document uploaded to that folder. You don't need to download the file to view the comments, etc., and should be able to click on the file and view in your browser -- note you may have issues if you do this on a mobile, so use a tablet, laptop or desktop preferably and USE CHROME which is the recommended Browser.

If you want to appeal your EBO grade, ensure you* read over the "EBO Appeals" page under the "EBO and Essay Assignments Info" page*. You must follow these processes, especially making clear if you are appealing or just chatting about your assignment. You can find your TA-Marker's email addresses on the TA Info page.

**Reminder: We have a 48-hour Thinking Period **so Markers won't be responding to any emails until January 3 (when the U re-opens as well), *and we strongly encourage you to review your EBO file and comments*, your EBO Gradesheet, etc. If you are interested in appealing the assessment, please read over the "EBO Appeals" page under the "EBO and Essay Assignments Info" page (see more info below). Note: if it's a technical matter like a missing EBO Mark sheet, no file emailed, then email me -- I'll respond as soon as possible, but note first priority is getting the EBO files emailed out.

        * Reply 2
    * can be point-form
    * generalities are not helpful and need to reference the assignment you submitted
    * wanting or needing a grade, etc., is not grounds for reassessment
    * submitting *the wrong file *or the *wrong version of a file* is NOT grounds for appeal, etc.
* refer to the assignment instructions, directions, etc., or other relevant documents to show the issues in the assessment
* the marker:
    * will read over your email and/or document to consider your points
    * may ask for a meeting (Zoom most likely) to clarify some matters or provide feedback
    * respond to your appeal via email so you both have a record of the decision
* concerns beyond the Marker's decision on your appeal can be made to Nig *after the Marker *has been engaged and a decision has been made
* *this process can take a couple of days so BE PATIENT and urgency is not necessitated or helpful*
* EBOs and Essays may be marked by different Markers but everyone uses the same criteria
* AFTER JAN 27: any appeals should be sent to Nig directly AND an explanation as to why you were unable to make the appeal by Jan 27 with the Marker

 


# Can't Use Undocumented Absence for EBO


---



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Concerning ‚ÄúUndocumented Absence‚Äù Academic Consideration:</span>
    * You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if the EBO deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise)
    * This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without penalty, to Friday, November 8, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Due Date of Monday, November 4* *
    * TO BE CLEAR: *this does not mean the EBO is ‚Äúreally‚Äù due on Friday, November 8*.  It is due on Monday, November 4, but after Friday, November 8 11:55pm, the EBO is considered late, but we will still accept submission until Friday, November 15 with a late penalty of -10% applied
    * Again, a request for academic consideration will not be considered if submitting between Friday, November 8 and Friday, November 15, because an extension was already granted, and the EBO is now late
    * Per Senate Regulations: ‚ÄúAn instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline‚Äù ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
    * Per Office of the Registrar FAQ ‚ÄúWhen CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied.‚Äù ([https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot))
* If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar‚Äôs Academic Consideration page [https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
* If you have documented grounds for a late submission extension beyond November 15, in that case, you should read the Registrar‚Äôs Academic Consideration page [https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html](https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html) and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
* Those students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines through Accessible Education (AE) should check the OWL site for your particular AE dates and other details and notes
