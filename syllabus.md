# Scaffolding: Why an Essay AND an EBO?

Politics requires us to listen to arguments, read analyse, and engage
with others ideas. One important aspect of Political Science, thus, is
learning to write clear, strong, well-researched and properly argued
essay. This is an important and impressive skill to master as you go
through your university education and for opportunities beyond after
graduation.

#### **What is Scaffolding?**

In order to help you learn to do this and develop those skills, we use a
**Scaffolding process** to help you learn to write a strong essay. What
is Scaffolding? \"Vygotsky coined a definition of instructional
scaffolding that focused on teacher practices. He defined this as, 'the
role of teachers and others in supporting the learner's development and
providing support structures to get to that next stage or level'
(Raymond, 2000).\"(1) More to the point, Loveless says, \"Scaffolding ..
was defined as breaking up learning into chunks so that students tackled
increasingly more complex material.\"(2) So, think of our Essay
Assignments process like a Video game: every level you gain new
education skills/powers, and then you use them to do well on the next
assignment which levels up from the last one.

#### **So how does the Scaffolding work?**

1.  Essay Bibliography and Outline (EBO): We will show you how to find
    peer-reviewed Academic sources for your EBO. You will have access to
    videos and other materials to find quality, scholarly sources, and
    an Essay Bibliography Worksheet that will help you work through how
    to find those sources. From there, you will collect and write up
    those sources following either Modern Language Association (MLA) or
    Chicago 17tth edition in the Essay Bibliography & Outline Worksheet,
    which you will submit. For the Outline portion, after reading and
    reviewing your sources, you will write down your two main arguments
    so you develop strong arguments, and ensure your arguments have
    support from your sources. A strong Essay Outline, as you will see,
    has a clear, focussed thesis \-- your central argument you are
    supporting/proving through the course of your essay \-- and
    supporting arguments. You will complete these tasks using the Essay
    Bibliography & Outline Worksheet, which you will submit.

2.  Final Essay: You pull together your research into a 1500-word Essay.
    Your EBO\'s sources & arguments will help you develop and write your
    Final Essay. The Final Essay has particular components -- thesis,
    arguments, opposing arguments, rebuttal/response, citations,
    bibliography/works cited etc. -- and you will have to show your
    ability to make coherent, interconnected, well-written,
    well-researched and well-argued analyses of and arguments about your
    essay topic.

Therefore, in our class, you will complete two assignments which
comprise the Essay: EBO and Final Essay. Details for each of these
assignments are provided on this OWL site.

# How do I Do Research, Find Sources, Use the Library Resources, etc., to complete the EBO?

## **What and where are some Resources, Videos, etc., for these Assignments?**

Now that you have a sense of what your final product is, you\'ll need to
begin how to go about researching. It\'s important that you review these
resources before you begin working on your assignments. If you decide to
jump into the assignment without fully reviewing this information,
chances are, you\'ll make needless errors. The library has provided
great resources that will be particularly helpful to prepare for this
assignment.

### **Where is the Library website? How do I get Off-Campus Access to the Library and its Resources so I don\'t pay extra to get articles, newspapers, etc.?**

**Western Libraries website:** <https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>

***How do I get off-campus access from home, out of
London/Ontario/Canada?***\
[Check out info here:
https://www.lib.uwo.ca/offcampus/index.htm](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/offcampus/index.html)

### **Where are Links to Weldon Political Science Librarian Christy Sich\'s Research Help pages?**

- [Databases
  for](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/politicalscience/corearticles) [articles
  (remember: still need to figure out the scholarly
  sources)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2213039)

- [Background Sources (not
  scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2187872)

- [UN & IGO sources (not
  scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2187872)

- [International News sources (not
  scholarly)](http://guides.lib.uwo.ca/c.php?g=262667&p=2212995)

### **What are Keywords?**

\"Keywords, also commonly called search terms, are the words that you
enter into the database search boxes. They represent the main concepts
of your research topic and are the words used in everyday life to
describe the topic. Without the right keywords, you may have difficulty
finding the articles that you need.

Selecting keywords is a multi-step process that involve

- identifying the main concepts of your topic

- brainstorming synonyms and antonyms that could also be used to
  describe your topic

- spell out abbreviations

It is very rare that your first search will bring back perfect results.
It takes trial and error to determine which keywords work best for your
topic. Be prepared to run multiple searches in your quest for the
keywords that will help you find the materials you need.

#### **Turn your topic into keywords**

When doing an internet search in Google or Bing, you can enter your
complete research question in the search box and get a bunch of results.
However, if you enter your entire research question in the Library
databases, you probably won\'t get any results. This is because the
library databases look for the exact words that you enter in the search
box(es). If the database can\'t find all of the words that you entered
in the search boxes in the information about an article, it won\'t bring
back any results. That\'s why it\'s important to search only for the
main parts of your topic.

Here is an example of a research question:

What is the relationship between test performance and the retention of
ESL students?

The keywords for this topic are listed below:

test performance\
retention\
ESL students

### **Synonyms**

Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meaning.

Some topics have many different terms that can be used to describe them.
For example, here are some additional keywords that could be used for
test performance:\
Tests\
Exams\
Test-Taking Skill\
Test Anxiety\
Academic Achievement\
Test Preparation

Source: Walden University Library, \"Keyword Searching: Finding Articles
on Your Topic: Select Keywords\",
<https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/library/keyword/search-strategy>

#### 

#### **Keywords can be \'horizontal\' and \'vertical\'**

Consider the topic of \"Indigenous rights in the Pacific Rim\" area.

Horizontal: a synonym for \"Pacific Rim\" could be \"New Zealand\",
\"Australia\", \"Oceania\"

Vertical: another approach might be to \'dig down\' to focus more on
what you want to explore, so \"Australia\" synonyms could be
\"Aborigines\", \"Queensland\" (where most live), \"Canberra\" (the
capital) \[in this case, one would be writing a paper on Indigenous
peoples of Australia\]

### **How do I write a Search-String to get On-Topic Sources?**

Search strings are combining Keywords and Synonyms \-- words you already
have worked out based on your topic and question \-- those words into a
Search statement For examples, you were doing the topic Canada\'s role
in global peacekeeping and decided you will look at one such mission in
Haiti, so one could search: Canada and peacekeeping and Haiti . These
are Keywords about the topic, and you could use some of the synonyms for
a second search string: Canada and food aid and Caribbean (food aid =
synonym for peacekeeping, and Caribbean = synonym for Haiti).

### **What is a Scholarly Source? How Can I Identify a Scholarly Source?**

### **What is the difference between Scholarly vs. Popular Sources?**

\"**Scholarly vs. Popular Sources**

Definition

A scholarly publication is one in which the content is written by
experts in a particular field of study - generally for the purpose of
sharing original research or analyzing others\' findings. Scholarly work
will thoroughly cite all source materials used and is usually subject to
\"peer review\" prior to publication. This means that independent
experts in the field review, or \"referee\" the publication to check the
accuracy and validity of its claims. The primary audience for this sort
of work is fellow experts and students studying the field. As a result
the content is typically much more sophisticated and advanced than
articles found in general magazines, or professional/trade journals.\
\
In brief, scholarly work is:\
- written by experts for experts\
- based on original research or intellectual inquiry\
- provides citations for all sources used\
- is usually peer reviewed\[\*\] prior to publication"

Source:
<https://guides.library.ubc.ca/EvaluatingSources/ScholarlyPopular>

\"**Scholarly Articles (Journals)**\
- Are written by and for faculty, researchers or scholars (chemists,
historians, doctors, artists, etc.)\
- Uses scholarly or technical language\
- Tend to be longer articles about research\
- Include full citations for sources\
- Are often refereed or peer reviewed (articles are reviewed by an
editor and other specialists before being accepted for publication)\
- Book reviews and editorials are not considered scholarly articles,
even when found in scholarly journals\"

THE QUIZ on this page!**

\"Some points to remember:

- Both magazine and journal articles can be good sources for your work.

- When selecting articles, think about how you intend to use the
  information:

  - Do you want background on a topic new to you? (use magazines)

  - Did your teacher say to cite scholarly resources? (use journals)

- Often a combination of the two will be most appropriate for
  undergraduate research. \"

### **How do I Search for Scholarly Sources through Weldon\'s Website? (don\'t use Google Scholar)**

### **Why not use Google Scholar?**

- You will be charged big \$\$ for articles and books access

- **You already paid big \$\$ for access to a lot more and better
  sources through your Tuition**

- You will **only see random 3-5 pages** from a source and this will
  become obvious to any marker

- It decides sources based on a marketing algorithm (that\'s where
  marketing decides what you should see), while Weldon is seeking the
  best resources for research (that\'s where Librarians are tweaking the
  search engine to get you good stuff so you do well on your essay)

- Some sources are NOT Scholarly \-- you cannot use the claim \'Google
  Scholar said it was\' when your sources get discounted

- Still, you can use Google Scholar to search [in addition
  to]{.underline} Weldon if you so decide, BUT check with Weldon\'s site
  for free access to the same sources.

### **Nig\'s How-To-Video for Searching for Academic Articles**

***This is My Video showing you how to Search for Scholarly Articles
through the Western Libraries\' website***

**Remember: your Tuition has given you access to this fantastic
Librarians-created Search Engine. You will NOT find better materials
through Google, and unless you want to blow \$30-\$100 bucks per article
access or try to figure out what\'s in a 200-page book or 20-page
article by reading 3-random pages selected by Google (recipe for
failure), then you really should use the Library\'s system AND get HELP
from Librarians!**

**Note:**

- **[Weldon\'s new FRONT SEARCH page is
  here](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/index.html) and it is slightly different
  than the one in this older video, BUT while there will be some
  differences from this video, the general instructions and suggestions
  can still be followed by just looking around for similar links,
  modifiers, etc.**

### **How do I Cite in MLA 9th edition and in Chicago 17th edition Styles?**

#### **DON\'T USE APA or any of the other 300+ styles.**

#### **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Citations and Bibliography/Works Cited are two different parts of the
  Essay

- Bibliography is your Sources \-- articles, book chapters, etc. \-- in
  your Essay and is at *end of your Essay* (MLA or Chicago) after the
  text (arguments, etc.) of your Essay

- Citations are you references to your Sources *inside your Essay*, and
  if they are in-line bracket references (MLA) or footnotes (Chicago),
  they are i the inside text-page of your Essay, however, if they are
  endnotes (Chicago) then they go after the text of your Essay but
  before your Bibliography/Works Cited

- You MUST pick ONLY ONE of either MLA Style or Chicago Style \-- don\'t
  mix!

- [ALWAYS include the page numbers]{.underline} for where you got your
  information, etc.

# How do I Approach Writing an Essay for Political Science?

**Why should I read this Essay writing guide?**

There are many writing guides available in the Bookstore and Libraries.
Below is a guide that focuses on our course\'s Essay. It proceeds by
asking common and reasonable essay-related questions and then proceeds
to answer them so you can write a strong, well-argued, well-evidenced
essay. The goal is to provide you effective direction and guidance, and
avoid many of the common mistakes and pitfalls that befuddle essays.

**What is an Argumentative Essay?**

You will be writing An Argumentative Essay. This is one type of essay
and its main goal is to defend a thesis by giving supporting reasons and
evidence. Thus, you should write a clear thesis -- your position on the
question -- which you will support through making arguments, providing
evidence from sources, and addressing objections to your thesis. Before
you write your essay or develop your thesis, make sure you understand
the question and spend some time brainstorming responses. As well, do
read all the sources so you will know what is the breadth and depth of
the issue. Thus, your essay should be using the approach of "This essay
argues" or "I will argue" as the catalyst and frame for doing the essay
(it is okay to use "I" in the essay if you prefer, but either way is
fine).

**When do I start the Essay?**

Now.

**Who is the audience for your essay?**

While your essay will likely only be read by you and the TA-Marker who
marks your essay, you should not be writing with that TA or Professor in
mind. Instead, consider writing the essay with a fellow student in mind.
This is a good strategy because it will force you to write so another
person can read it and understand it. You will avoid writing an obtuse,
inaccessible or jargon-filled essay. Instead, your essay will be
readable by anyone because you have written it clearly and succinctly,
explaining or defining terms, and make arguments that can be understood.
As well, you will provide proper evidence and examples to that the
reader can intelligently and readily follow your arguments and see they
are supported. Another important point: you will need to walk your
reader through the essay step-by-step so you will need to develop your
ideas to show them, rather than assume they are self-evident because you
stated them. In other words, your ideas and evidence need to convince
the average reasonably informed reader, so write accordingly.

**What is the thesis?**

Your thesis is your main claim or position in response to the question
your essay is addressing. Your thesis is the main point or goal or
purpose you are going to defend with arguments and evidence. You should
state your thesis as a single sentence, such as "I argue ..." or "The
state's policy on gambling should be ...". If you have reasons or
arguments in support of this position, you can put those in the next
sentence or sentences. Also, once you have completed your whole essay,
go back and check over your thesis to make sure you have argued and
supported your thesis -- otherwise change your thesis so that it
concords with what you have argued and proven in the essay. Also, what
you argue is up to you as long as your thesis is reasonable and can be
supported by the evidence in the sources.

**What should be in my Introduction?**

The Introduction is the first paragraph of your essay and it should,
above all else, tell us what is your topic-question and what is your
thesis. You must state the question you have chosen (if not the question
itself, then a reasonable version of it without changing the question
focus) and, in the next sentence, state your thesis. Then, consider
answering the 'so what' question: why is this topic important to
consider? Give us some idea why this might be an important topic in your
view. You can also provide some context or background that you think is
relevant. However, avoid 'cosmic clichés' or 'grandiose claims' like
'since the dawn of time', 'there is only one issue that has ever
mattered to anyone', etc. As well, you may give us a 'road map' of your
essay that gives a preview of how your essay is structured and flows
(this helps the reader know how you are going to proceed through the
essay). In addition, you may want to define select terms that have
specific meanings or definitions, but you do not need to define
everything and some of these terms may be better defined in the body of
your essay. In short, the Introduction should ensure that, at the least,
the reader:

- Knows the question which the essay is addressing (the essay question)

- Knows your position or claim in response to the question (your thesis)

- Understands why you think the topic is important to consider

Note, however, a simple Introduction -- just doing the above in 3
sentences -- is a bad Introduction as it should also introduce or
contextualize the topic and question, and show you understand the topic
and question more fully than just the bear minimum. Also, you can put
your thesis wherever you think is appropriate but ensure you use words
-- 'This essay argues', 'The claim here is', 'I will prove that' -- to
make clear the thesis to the reader -- it is the writer's job to make
sure their thesis can be identified and understood by the reader in the
essay.

**What is the Body?**

The Body is not a single thing; the Body of your essay is many
paragraphs composed of many sentences. Do not write a 'hamburger' or '3
para' essay for 1500-words, across 5-6 pages -- such essays do badly.
The Body has many paragraphs, and these paragraphs will bring forward
your arguments and their evidence, the objections to your thesis & their
evidence, and your reply to the objections.

Thus, you will need many paragraphs to do this -- and many sentences
(minimum of 3) inside each paragraph. Think of each paragraph as 'unit
of thought': opening sentence is sign-post telling the reader what the
paragraph is about; then put forward your argument or arguments; provide
the evidence, sources and support for those arguments; and, close the
paragraph by summarizing for the reader the main point of the paragraph.
Thus, the first sentence of the paragraph should tell us what the
paragraph will put forward but also how it is connected to the paragraph
before it, e.g. 'I begin by arguing 'no platform...' so next paragraph
may start 'Having covered 'no platform', we can now look at the first
objection to this ...'. Thus, the Body will bring forward your various
arguments and your researched evidence.

**What is the 'Argument, Objection, Reply' (AOR) format?**

While your thesis is your main claim, you will need to make arguments.
Well-argued essays generally will follow [Graff & Birkenstein's 'They
Say/I Say' format (click
here)](https://www.rcboe.org/cms/lib/GA01903614/Centricity/Domain/10616/They%20Say%20I%20Say%20Full%20Text.pdf)
which focuses on laying out arguments and analyses of others and then
responding to them. In the case of our essay, we are suggesting a
modified version of this. First, show the reader your main Argument (in
support of your thesis): what are you arguing in order to prove your
thesis and what is your evidence and support for this argument from your
sources? Next, show the reader an Objection or Objections to your
argument, again providing evidence that backs up the objection -- this
is also called a 'charitable' presentation of the objection(s) because
you want to show the reader you understand and can present the objection
properly, not sloppily or dismissively. Finally, Reply to the
Objections: what do you argue to refute, oppose, disprove the
Objections, based on evidence and sources. In all cases, you are using
your sources to provide evidence to back up your arguments, objections
and replies. In addition, the AOR format will ensure you show you can
reason and understand your thesis with a number of supporting arguments,
but also defend against reasoned and understood objections. This also
creates a conversation flow to your essay, so the reader sees your
arguments develop and will see if you can defend them against
objections.

How many arguments do you need to support your thesis? Here it is
important to stress we are looking for quality not quantity. For
example, if you decide to make 6 arguments with objections and replies,
your essay will have no depth and lack sources and evidence to support
them -- an argument every 350 words. However, if you do 2 arguments, and
their objections and replies, you are more likely to have depth --
evidence, examples, sources and quotes -- to support your thesis, and
will do better on the essay. Thus, do not aim for quantity of arguments
but depth of arguments.

So, what makes a good Argument'? A good argument puts forward a
reasonable point or claim that links to the thesis, then seeks to prove
it with evidence, sources, quotes, examples, etc. A good argument
supports the thesis and is itself supported. Consequently, the good
argument is reasonable, defensible and evidenced. It also follows the
saying: "Show me, don't tell me"; in other words, prove it with evidence
and sources to persuade the reader, and do not rely on or demand the
reader has to take your word for it (they will not as they are expecting
you to do your job and prove your points).

So, what makes a good Objection and good Reply? In both cases, as with a
Good Argument, you need to provide evidence and proof. As well, you need
to provide 'charitable' presentation of the Objection; this means
present it properly with evidence, as if you were making that as your
argument, and do not simply choose those parts of the Objection that are
easy to shoot down because they are, in fact, an incomplete or incorrect
or skewed presentation of the Objection. Give the Objection a reasonably
positive or favourable presentation before your Reply -- critique,
disprove or pull apart -- to the Objection. Once you have laid out the
Objection, think of a strong Reply to the Objection, and make sure you
provide evidence to back up your Reply. Again, as with the good
Argument, choose quality over quantity, so you have depth to your
analysis.

Also, don't be shy: edit and be a ruthless editor. Pick only your
strongest arguments and evidence to put forward, that is, arguments you
can discuss and prove with depth, i.e. sources and evidence. Similarly,
pick the best Objections and Reply to them. Avoid choosing 'novel' or
'unique' arguments for the sake of 'being different'; novelty without
depth is not going to receive a good grade.

**What is the Conclusion?**

The Conclusion ties together your essay. In it, you want to remind the
reader of the question you responded to, your thesis, and a summary of
your arguments, objections and replies. Never introduce new information,
arguments, etc., that has not already been argued or discussed in the
essay. In addition, based on what you have argued, you are welcome to
suggest further research questions or ideas others can research or
analyse.

**Why do I need to Revise, Review or have a Friend look it over?**

Avoid submitting your first-and-only version of your essay. You need to
learn to manage your time to research, to write, and give yourself time
to edit. A great saying from one of prof's: "Writing is easy; re-writing
is hard"; editing means looking over your words, making sure you have
selected the right words to make your points, or provided the best
evidence to support your arguments, or ensuring your arguments prove
your thesis, or making sure your spelling and grammar are not
problematic or incorrect. One way to avoid a lot of errors: have a
friend or someone else read it over because sometimes what you have
written is not the same as what was in your mind or your choice of words
does not make that point. Many essays drop in overall grade because of
careless errors and problems which make them difficult to read, flow or
understand, and all that could have been avoided by taking a few minutes
to edit the essay. As well, note that Clarity and Organization are
important criteria in assessing your essay, so get someone to read over
and critique your essay, so it is clearer and better argued.

**Why I should cite from the my Sources?**

It is important to cite your ideas, quotations, etc., to show the reader
you got those materials from Sources. The more you use your Sources in
the essay and provide the citations, it is likely you will do better
because the Marker will see you have used all sources and have grappled
with the issues. When you cite, you are giving a clear indication to the
reader your ideas are supported, backed or drawing on others who have
made similar arguments or provide proof for your ideas. Similarly, for
Objections and Replies, sources show you properly understand the other
sides to the debate, that is, you did not just pull stuff out of the
air.

**How should I incorporate my Sources into my essay?**\
There are many ways to do this. You can do the well-known 'quotation
sandwich': introduce the quote or quote's author, then provide the
quote, and then explain the point or connection of the quote to your
argument. You can claim 'As Narain argues, ..." and paraphrase their
point (don't use some or part of their words; if you are using their
words, then just quote them). You can provide your evidence or discuss
your examples, etc., and then cite the source where it comes from.
Again, all this will help the reader to know you did your research and
have understood the necessary ideas, etc. As well, you will do better on
your essay overall because you will have proven and supported your
claims.

**What is Plagiarism?**

If you pass off other people's word, ideas, examples, etc., as your own
in your essay, that will constitute plagiarism. Just as you do not want
someone to steal your ideas, words, etc., do not steal those of others,
either. The Course Outline, the Appendices, and various documents on
UWO's websites provide fuller details of the standards and possible
punishments.

**Can I bring in a draft to be read?**

We will not be reading over drafts.

**Any final advice?**

YES: Pick an Essay topic-question that you will enjoy doing -- if you
have fun doing it, you will likely do better on it. If you have
questions or concerns, use the Essay Bot and please do connect with us.

### **What is the Essay?**

Our course is an is an Essay course, so you must research, write and
submit a 1500-word Final Essay. The Essay is an Argumentative essay
with Arguments, Objections and Replies. It should have a Thesis, or
central argument/claim, 2-3 major arguments in support of the Thesis and
supported with evidence and sources. To help you with this, you will
complete and submit the Essay Outline and will receive comments and a
grade.

### **What is the Length of the Final Essay?**

The Essay should be 1**,500 words**. The [maximum]{.underline} is 1700
words. The [minimum]{.underline} permissible length 1300 words. Below
1300 or over 1,700, at the discretion of the Professors and/or TAs, will
receive a penalty of -5% and will definitely be downgraded.

**NOTE: Essays less than 1000 will receive a maximum grade of 48%/F or
less.**

**How should I write the Essay?**

**Read the "How should I approach Writing my Poli Sci Essay?" document**
on the Class OWL site. This document explains how to write an
argumentative essay and you are responsible for knowing what is written
in that document AND for following through in writing your essay
accordingly.

### **What are the Essay Topics?**

1.  **Should Canada pursue the recommendations of the Truth and
    Reconciliation Commission? Focus on 2-3 recommendations.**

2.  **On balance, has globalization's impact been positive or negative?
    Compare the case of 2 countries.**

3.  **Should nuclear weapons be banned?**

4.  **Are global pandemics best managed by international cooperation or
    by states acting on their own?**

5.  **Is the American War on Terror a failure?**

6.  **Should Canada be accepting more refugees?**

NOTE: write your Essay in relation to the current time period, so for
example, don't write about the American War of Independence as
'secession' from England in 1770s

### **How many Academic Scholarly Articles should I use in the Final Essay?**

As many as will help you make your arguments strong, evidenced, cited
and proven, as well as opposing argument credibly presented and refuted.
Still, **you need to have [used at least 7]{.underline} academic
scholarly articles cited in your Essay**. If you don't have [at least 7
academic/scholarly sources cited]{.underline} in your Essay, your grade
maximum will be 60% and less than 5 will . To help you with this, you
will complete and submit the Essay Bibliography, and will receive a
grade and feedback/comments.

**NOTE: Essays less than 5 academic scholarly articles will receive a
maximum grade of 48%/F or less.**

*Reminder: grey literature, such as government sources, long-form
magazines or news articles, research paper, NGO or corporate reports,
dissertations, etc., will not be considered as academic scholarly
articles, and don\'t use blogs, websites, etc., except for background
information and research; you can cite these sources as well, that\'s
fine, but they won\'t replace using and relying on scholarly articles
for evidence, etc.*

### **How should I format the Essaay?**

Your Essay should be in 12-point Arial or Helvetica or Verdana or
Calibri (avoid Times or Bookman, if possible, but no grades are lost for
using a Serif font and should be double-spaced and left-justified.

Generally, please format using 1" margins, so your essay will be about
5-7 pages. Bibliography/Works Cited go at the end of the essay. Note
that we use Word Count so squeezing or expanding your margins serves no
useful purpose at all.

*NO subheadings*: learn to use Transitions between paragraphs and major
sections.

### **How are you grading my essay?**

Your essay will be graded according to the following criteria:

#### **Reasoning:**

a.  Do you have a [clear thesis]{.underline}? (your [main
    claim]{.underline} in response to the question)

b.  Have you [developed arguments]{.underline} to support your thesis?

c.  Have you selected [reasonable objections]{.underline}?

d.  Do you have [evidence from the sources]{.underline} to support your
    claims?

e.  Are your [examples relevant, appropriate and sourced]{.underline}?

f.  Are your thesis, objections and replies and your arguments
    [defended]{.underline}?

#### **Understanding:**

a.  Have you [responded]{.underline} to the question?

b.  Have you [understood relevant ideas and issues]{.underline}?

c.  Have you explored [objections fairly and charitably]{.underline}?

d.  Have you [responded with reasonable replies]{.underline} to the
    objections?

e.  Did you [discuss all required sources]{.underline}?

#### **Clarity and Organization:**

a.  Can your arguments be [understood and followed]{.underline}?

b.  Do your [arguments, objections and replies connect and
    flow]{.underline}?

c.  Are your paragraphs ['units of thought']{.underline}?

d.  Have you [edited]{.underline} your essay?

e.  Does your essay have [*few to none* spelling and grammar
    errors]{.underline}?

#### **Citations and Referencing:**

a.  [Quality and appropriateness]{.underline} of your selected research
    materials

b.  Have you followed EITHER Chicago [footnote/endnote
    style]{.underline} OR Modern Language Association (MLA) [in-text
    bracket style]{.underline}?

c.  Have you provided [page numbers]{.underline} for all your citations?

d.  Have you [cited from most, if not all, sources]{.underline}?

e.  Have you [properly used quotations]{.underline} for materials/text
    from your sources?

f.  Have you [used Academic articles and books]{.underline}?

While these are 4 key areas, each one is part of holistic assessment.

### **[When do I cite information?]{.underline}**

Cite anything that is an idea or evidence from your sources. Definitely
cite any quoted information -- that is, you are using the exact same
words as your source. Remember: [changing words is not
sufficient]{.underline} to not require you to use quotes and cite the
source! (It can also be plagiarism.) Thus, cite the source and page
number [every time]{.underline} you directly quote a source OR when you
paraphrase an idea from a source OR when a particular idea or piece of
information comes from the source (even when you don't quote it
directly).

Essays without Chicago footnotes/endnotes or MLA in-line bracket
citation will receive an additional --10% penalty regardless of grade
achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).

Essays with poorly done Citations may be levied a -5% penalty regardless
of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 5% = 43%).

### **[Do I have to provide a Bibliography or Works Cited?]{.underline}**

You must include a Bibliography (Chicago) or Works Cited (MLA)
identifying, in alphabetical order by surname, the readings you used in
writing your essay. If you divide up your sources by source type (book
or article), that is okay, although, technically not correct but you
won't lose marks.

Essays without a Bibliography receive a --10% penalty regardless of
grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).

Essays with poorly done Bibliographies may be levied a -5% penalty
regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 5% = 43%.

EBO Frequently-Asked Questions
(EBO FAQs)
“The difference between ‘reAd it’ and ‘reDdit’ is an A versus a D” 
– Nig Narain

Late Updated: Oct 1
(Note that some of the direction the EBO Bot may give is not fully nuanced or correct, so it's your responsibility to review all the information posted on the OWL site to confirm the AI gave you correct information and correct it yourself, and even the AI Bot always cautions: "There may be errors in my responses; always refer to the course web page.")

ALSO, topic-specific questions will be answered on the Essay-FAQ page, while more general EBO questions are discussed below.

Q: Should I read the Essay pages and watch all the videos on how to do research?
A: Yes

Q: Is this an annotated bibliography?
A: No. Nowhere is it stated that this is an annotated bibliography, so don’t invent requirements. If you did write one, it will be disregarded and you must still meet all other assignment requirements.

Q: Can I change my sources as I do more research?
A: Yes. Improve your sources and aim for stronger research.

Q: Can I change my essay topic from what I wrote about in the EBO?
A: No. If you change your topic-question from the EBO, you will lose your EBO grade (0%), though your essay grade still stands.

Q: What if an academic article doesn’t have page numbers?
A: All articles have page numbers — you may need to dig deeper. You must include them (e.g., pp. 725–738).

Q: Do I have to do one of the topics listed in the Essay Assignment?
A: Yes. Choosing your own topic will result in a grade of 0 for both the EBO and/or Essay.

Q: Do I just need 10 sources for full marks?
A: No. Ten is the minimum (worth a passing grade).
10 = 2.5 (pass)
11 = 3
12 = 4
13+ = 5

Q: How do I come up with keywords?
A: Watch the linked videos and review the PowerPoint. Use keywords and synonyms directly tied to your topic (not vague generalities).
Example – Topic: War Crimes in Yugoslavia
War crimes → genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity
International Criminal Court → UN, Security Council, The Hague
Yugoslavia → Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia

Q: Do I have to provide page numbers for articles?
A: Yes. Example (MLA):
Bousfield, Dan. “Revisiting Cyber-Diplomacy: Canada–China Relations Online.” Globalizations, vol. 14, no. 6, Aug. 2017, pp. 1045–59.

Q: Do I need to check citations when using library generators or ezBib?
A: Yes. Especially ensure journal names and page numbers are correct.

Q: Can I list sources from 2009 and earlier?
A: No. Sources must be published from 2010 onwards.

Q: Do I have to provide DOIs and URLs for scholarly academic journal articles?
A: Not required. You may include them if you want, but no marks are added or deducted.

Q: After I get my EBO back, can I change my arguments and sources as I do more research?
A: Yes. Improve your sources and arguments as needed. You can replace weak sources from your EBO and strengthen your essay.

Q: Is the thesis one sentence only?
A: Yes. Your thesis must be one clear sentence. Supporting arguments can follow in later sentences. Do not include counter-arguments or rebuttals in your thesis.

Q: Does my thesis only have to be a response to the question?
A: Yes. It should directly answer the essay question. You may add more sentences after, but clarity is key.

Q: Can I make more than 3 main arguments to support the thesis?
A: No. Aim for depth, not breadth. The essay is 1500 words, so 3 strong arguments are expected.

Q: How many sentences per argument?
A: 3–5 sentences per argument, counter-argument, and rebuttal. Maximum of 5 sentences each.

Q: Can I use bullet points?
A: Yes, but they must be full sentences. Limit 3–5 bullet points per section.

Q: Do I need to provide sources, citations, or bibliography for the Essay Outline?
A: No. Including them is optional but will not affect your grade.

Q: May I include my arguments or elaboration in the thesis?
A: Preferably not. Save arguments for sentences after the thesis. In some cases it may work, depending on the topic.

Q: Do I have to use “I” in my thesis?
A: You may use “I argue…”, “This essay argues…”, or similar. Avoid “I feel” or “It shook me”.

Q: After my EBO was returned, I found other sources. Do I need to resubmit the EBO?
A: No. You should always be seeking better sources, but no resubmission is required.

Q: If my EBO question asks me to focus on case studies, do I state them after my thesis?
A: Yes. Mention them after your thesis or in your arguments.

Q: Do I have to provide examples or case studies?
A: Only if your question requires them. Otherwise they are optional but can help your arguments.

Q: Can I change my examples or case studies?
A: Yes, as long as they still meet the requirements of your essay question.

Q: What if I catch a last-minute error and want to resubmit?
A: You may resubmit only until the submission link deadline. The new file will override the old one. No resubmissions by email.

Q: What if the link shows “Late” after my submission goes through?
A: If OWL uploads your file before the deadline but marks it “Late,” you will not be penalized.

Q: What if the link closes as I’m submitting and it does not show a submission?
A: Then it is considered not submitted. Submissions must be completed before the link closes.

Q: What do I do if I missed the on-time submission deadline and the link is closed?
A: Submit at the next available deadline through the Late Penalty link.

Q: What do I do if I missed the late submission deadline and the link is closed?
A: Unless you have academic consideration, you will not be allowed to submit and will receive 0.

Q: Can I use a style guide other than MLA 9 or Chicago 17?
A: No.

Q: Do I have to use MLA 9 style?
A: Yes, unless you use Chicago 17.

Q: Do I have to use Chicago 17 style?
A: Yes, unless you use MLA 9.

Q: Do I have to list sources for each argument or opposing argument?
A: No. You may keep track for yourself but it is not required in the essay outline.

Q: Do I have to go to the library in person to do my research?
A: No.

Q: Do I have to read the sources in the library even if they are online?
A: No. Once logged in through the library website, you can read them anywhere.

# Essay instructions page https://westernu.brightspace.com/d2l/le/lessons/130641/lessons/3405168

What are the Instructions for the Essay?

What is the Essay?
Our course is an is an Essay course, so you must research, write and submit a 1,500-word Final Essay.  The Essay is an Argumentative essay with Arguments, Objections and Replies. It should have a Thesis, or central argument/claim, 2-3  major arguments in support of the Thesis and supported with evidence and sources. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Outline and will receive comments and a grade.

What is the Length of the Final Essay?
The Essay should be 1,500 words. The maximum is 1700 words. The minimum permissible length 1300 words. Below 1300 or over 1,700, at the discretion of the Professors and/or TAs, will receive a penalty of -5% and will definitely be downgraded.

NOTE: Essays less than 1000 will receive a maximum grade of 48%/F or less.

How should I write the Essay?

Read the “How should I approach Writing my Poli Sci Essay?” document on the Class OWL site. This document explains how to write an argumentative essay and you are responsible for knowing what is written in that document AND for following through in writing your essay accordingly.

What are the Essay Topics?
Should Canada pursue the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Focus on 2-3 recommendations.
On balance, has globalization’s impact been positive or negative? Compare the case of 2 countries.
Should nuclear weapons be banned?
Are global pandemics best managed by international cooperation or by states acting on their own?
Is the American War on Terror a failure?
Should Canada be accepting more refugees?
NOTE: write your Essay in relation to the current time period, so for example, don’t write about the American War of Independence as ‘secession’ from England in 1770s

How many Academic Scholarly Articles should I use in the Final Essay?
As many as will help you make your arguments strong, evidenced, cited and proven, as well as opposing argument credibly presented and refuted. Still, you need to have used at least 7 academic scholarly articles cited in your Essay. If you don’t have at least 7 academic/scholarly sources cited in your Essay, your grade maximum will be 60% and less than 5 will likely be a failure. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Bibliography and Outline, and will receive a grade and feedback/comments.

 NOTE: Essays less than 5 academic scholarly articles will receive a maximum grade of 48%/F or less.

Reminder: grey literature, such as government sources, long-form magazines or news articles, research paper, NGO or corporate reports, dissertations, etc., will not be considered as academic scholarly articles, and don't use blogs, websites, etc., except for background information and research; you can cite these sources as well, that's fine, but they won't replace using and relying on scholarly articles for evidence, etc.

How should I format the Essaay?
Your Essay should be in 12-point Arial or Helvetica or Verdana or Calibri (avoid Times or Bookman, if possible, but no grades are lost for using a Serif font and should be double-spaced and left-justified.

Generally, please format using 1” margins, so your essay will be about 5-7 pages. Bibliography/Works Cited go at the end of the essay. Note that we use Word Count so squeezing or expanding your margins serves no useful purpose at all.

NO subheadings: learn to use Transitions between paragraphs and major sections.

How are you grading my essay?
Your essay will be graded according to the following criteria:

Reasoning:
Do you have a clear thesis? (your main claim in response to the question)
Have you developed arguments to support your thesis?
Have you selected reasonable objections?
Do you have evidence from the sources to support your claims?
Are your examples relevant, appropriate and sourced?
Are your thesis, objections and replies and your arguments defended?
Understanding:
Have you responded to the question?
Have you understood relevant ideas and issues?
Have you explored objections fairly and charitably?
Have you responded with reasonable replies to the objections?
Did you discuss all required sources?
Clarity and Organization:
Can your arguments be understood and followed?
Do your arguments, objections and replies connect and flow?
Are your paragraphs ‘units of thought’?
Have you edited your essay?
Does your essay have few to none spelling and grammar errors?
Citations and Referencing:
Quality and appropriateness of your selected research materials
Have you followed EITHER Chicago footnote/endnote style OR Modern Language Association (MLA) in-text bracket style?
Have you provided page numbers for all your citations?
Have you cited from most, if not all, sources?
Have you properly used quotations for materials/text from your sources?
Have you used Academic articles and books?
While these are 4 key areas, each one is part of holistic assessment.

When do I cite information?
Cite anything that is an idea or evidence from your sources. Definitely cite any quoted information – that is, you are using the exact same words as your source. Remember: changing words is not sufficient to not require you to use quotes and cite the source! (It can also be plagiarism.) Thus, cite the source and page number every time you directly quote a source OR when you paraphrase an idea from a source OR when a particular idea or piece of information comes from the source (even when you don’t quote it directly).

Essays without Chicago footnotes/endnotes or MLA in-line bracket citation will receive an additional –10% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).

Essays with poorly done Citations may be levied a -5% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 5% = 43%).

Do I have to provide a Bibliography or Works Cited?
You must include a Bibliography (Chicago) or Works Cited (MLA) identifying, in alphabetical order by surname, the readings you used in writing your essay. If you divide up your sources by source type (book or article), that is okay, although, technically not correct but you won’t lose marks.

Essays without a Bibliography receive a –10% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).

Essays with poorly done Bibliographies may be levied a -5% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 5% = 43%.

TO BE CLEAR: this does not mean the Essay is “really” due on Tuesday, December 9; it is due on Wednesday, December 3. But after Tuesday, December 9 at 11:59pm, the Essay is considered late. We will still accept submission until Wednesday, December 10 at 11:00pm, with a late penalty of -10% applied.
The aforementioned also applies to the Late -10% Essay with respectively adjusted dates
Again, any requests for academic consideration will not be considered if submitting between between Wednesday, December 3 and Tuesday, December 16 11:59pm because extensions were already granted and accounted for in the due dates and no-penalty lee way dates
Per Senate Regulations: “An instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
Per Office of the Registrar FAQ “When CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
If you have documented grounds for a late submission beyond Dec 16, in that case, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
Those students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines through Accessible Education should check the OWL site for your particular AE dates and other details and notes

List from ThoughtCo.com: https://www.thoughtco.com/
Shorter list from UWO Writing: http://writing.uwo.ca/img/pdfs/handouts_new/Transition%20Signals.pdf
Do I have to have a clear thesis to do well on this Essay?
Yes
Should I state my 2 arguments in the Introduduction ?
Yes
State your thesis and then state your arguments
Does word count matter more than # of pages?
Yes
Word count is what we assess so ensure you are meeting the word count minimums
# of pages can be affected by font size, margins, spacing, and other factors 
How many marks do I lose if I am over or under the word limit? 
1500-word count
We are permitting:
below 1,300 words = -5% penalty
above 1,700 words = -5% penalty
This is means a leeway of 300-words under/over (or 10% word count leeway) with no penalty, but anything more gets a penalty most likely
We do exercise discretion and best efforts in assessing this penalty
What can I do if I’m still short of the word count?
Evidence, examples with citations
Most essays who are low/below word count also usually have no to poor evidence cited from sources, so read like an opinion-piece rather than an argumentative essay
What can I do if I’m over the word count?
Trim passive sentences, long quotes, repetitive sentences, unnecessarily excessive replicated verbiage
E.g. ‘unnecessarily excessive replicated verbiage’ could be replaced with ‘repeated big words’ – which also makes the point clearer
Remove adverbs, adjectives, etc., that are don’t add anything, e.g. ‘there are many reasons for this as it is involving’ = ‘the reasons for this include’
Can I use headings & sub-headings? 
NO
If you initially use them to organize the essay, then do delete them before you submit your final copy
When you start your essay you may organize it by using some headings & sub-headings BUT you must remove them before submitting your final copy
Replace the headings with Transitions, as discussed in the "How To Write..." document 
Here is a list of various Transition words: https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/
Introduction

Does my Introduction para have to have the Essay Question?
Yes,
Will ensure you actually respond to the question
Should state question before you start your thesis
Can state passively as well:
Active: "Is a federal system of state or a unitary form of state better?
Passive: There is debate about whether a federal state or a unitary state is a better form of state. 
Can I use "I" as in "I would argue", etc.?
Yes.
Personal pronouns are permitted; BUT be careful to write arguments, e.g. "I argue", "I assert", "I claim", and NOT feelings, e.g. "I feel", "I believe", "I love", "I hate" -- those later words often lead to moving away from evidence and arguments into unprovable and untenable areas
Can I say 'This essay argues...', 'My argument is that...', 'The position taken here is...' instead of "I ..."
Yes, those are all fine as long you are focussing on arguing, asserting, and making claims (not 'I feel that' or 'it shook me to see')
 Does my Introduction para have to my Thesis stated?
Yes
State clearly your position in response to the question, and ensure you are answering the essay question
Thesis can be a simple: "I argue nuclear weapons should be banned"
Thesis can be complex: "This essay asserts nuclear should not be banned because ..."
Can I change sides in my thesis?
Yes
Welcome to change sides from what you asserted in the EO
Does my Introduction para need to have my 2 arguments stated?
Yes
May attach them to the thesis, .e.g. "This essay asserts nuclear should not be banned because ..."
May be their own separate sentences after thesis
Should not be longer than a sentence for each one, but short statement of each is just as fine
Does my Introduction need to have my Objections and Replies?
No
Also fine if you choose to state them in the Introductin
Avoid writing lengthy write-up of these in the Introduction
Don't write more than 1 para for the Introduction
Should I state my Case Studies?
If they are required as part of your question, you should state them in the Introduction para
Does my Introduction have to be just one para?
Yes
Don’t waste words with excessive background, lay-up, etc. – you can do this in a para after the Intro 1st para
May I write 2-3 Introduction paras?
No
If I want to provide background and definitions, may I put them in a separate para?
Yes, put them after yoru Introduction para
Avoid a very long or extensive background/definition para
Argument-Objection-Reply
Can I change my arguments as I do more research?
Yes!
Improve your sources, get better research and make better arguments
Do I need to follow the A-O-R structure for the Essay?
Yes
Ensures you make and evidence an Argument, explain and explore the Objections, and provide a thoughtful Reply
For AOR, would these three be one paragraph each? 
It is best to write each A-O-R in 3 separate paras
Argument should be longer than Objection; Objection should be longer than Reply
Give depth and provide evidence to your arguments, objection, reply as well
One structure you may consider: 
Argument: 2 paras, 1 for argument, 1 for evidence(s) for the argument
Objection: 2 paras, 1 for objection, 1 for evidence(s) for the objection
Rebuttal: 1 para for countering the objection with evidence
Do I have to address the questions theoretically or can I focus on the just arguments? 
Don't try to tackle theory, unless you truly want to and will work to understand the relevant theory properly
Focus on your arguments, providing evidence for them, and ensuring you have citations from sources 
Can I make more than 2 main arguments to support the thesis?
No
It's like a good date: 2 good date events/things are better than 10 events packed in and no time for depth of experience
Can I just write about one case study as my argument(s) or thesis?
NO
A case study or example is NOT an argument
Thesis should NOT be a statement indicating one case is better than another case as it's about the topic, not the case study
Don't write: I argue India's parlimentary system is more democratic than France's semi-presidential system
Do write: I argue a parlimentary system is more democratic than a semi-presidential system. I argue a parlimentary system is more democratic than a semi-presidential system. I will compare India and France.
Also, better to compare two cases with depth, than touch-n-go a bunch of cases, so stick to just 2 case studies
Put forward arguments, and then your case study or examples back up that argument
So, use the example or case study to prove an argument BUT don't claim the example is the argument
ALSO, you can also state in the introduction that you are primarily focusing on a case or example, but note that only using one case or example leaves your argument open to critique that you have only one supporting case example; so better to dig into the one case BUT ALSO draw on some other examples as well (even if just a little bit to show another example to bolster your arguments and essay overall)
How should I use my cases?
You may use one case for your argument, the other for the counter
You may use one case to provide for your argument and its counter-argument
You may examine both cases in each of your arguments BUT be cautious that you still have sufficient examination of the cases
Can I re-use my EBO text word-for-word (copy-and-paste) into my essay for my arguments, etc.?
Yes
It's not self-plagiarism; it would be plagiarism if you submitted the essay and then use from your own submitted essay in a paper next year or in another class
Conclusion
Should my Conclusion have the Question, Thesis, and a summary of my arguments, objections and replies?
Yes, and this would be in the past tense as you’ve ‘done’ all this in the Essay
Should I introduce new arguments or evidence?
No
May I point to implications of my arguments?
Yes 
May I point to other questions, queries, research, etc., which could be done by someone else?
No
Do I restate my thesis in the Conclusion?
Yes
Don't change your thesis or arguments at the end as that shows that
Conclusions should tie up the Essay, arguments, summarize any key evidence 
Sources: Evidence
In addition to Scholarly Academic sources, may I use non-academic sources such as magazines, website, policy briefs, working papers, etc.
They will not count towards your academic sources' use and citing
Yes but try to find academic sources for the same info if possible
If you need current statistics, policies, etc., these can be useful but avoid over-reliance (or only source) on them for data, etc.
Remember to check that their info is valid; for example, in 2003, many newspapers, magazines, etc., reported Iraq had nuclear weapons, but late 2003, they were printing retractions and corrections to this information
Avoid blogs, op-eds, etc.
Government sources are also fine
NOTE: pay attention to citation styles for websites as that is done differently than for scholarly articles or scholarly books
FYI: scholarly articles from websites cannot be cited as website but must be properly cited as scholarly articles AND same applies for e-books
Can I use sources from 2010 and earlier?
Sources before 2010 will NOT count for the minimum number of academic sources
It is recommended to use more contemporary/newer sources, closer to the current time/last decade
If you use old sources, acknowledge they are old and why you used them, e.g, As Ching-Mei, writing in 1999 just after India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests, notes China's response was ... (Ching-Mei, 529)
How do I show the Marker I actually used a source in my Essay?
Cite it! by:
Quoting from it
Paraphrasing forn it
Drawsome information from it like statistic
Indicating the source generally supports or alludes to a claim you are making
Reminder:  you need to provide citations regularly in your Essay
How many academic scholarly journal article sources minimum should I have used in my Essay?
7 is the minimum, and that means you drew on the 7 academic scholarly journal articles and cited them
A minimum is not sufficient to do well or great
More than 7 will likely mean you'll do better and provide better support, evidence, arguments, analysis
Will I do better if I use more than 7 academic scholarly journal articles in my Essay?
Yes
To do well, you'll need to use more than 7 academic sources
Historically, those who use predominantly, if not all, academic sources, and more than 7, write the best essays and do well
Can I change my sources from the ones I used in my EBO as I do more research?
Yes!
Improve your academic scholarly sources and get better research = better analysis & data = better arguments and essay
Note: changing sources does not always mean 'better' so make sure you don't mistakenly get rid of good sources
Do I have to have certain mix of scholarly sources?
No; you can use books or articles as you see fit
Reminder: non-scholarly sources are fine, but you need to be largely using scholarly sources
Do I have to use all or most the sources for the topic on which I am writing?
Yes, please use all or most the sources; BUT they don’t have to be used equally
You may end up focussing some, but figure out how to substantively incorporate the other academic sources as well even if just for some stats, to back up further an argument from another source, or use it only for an objection to one or both of your arguments
Using less than 7 drops you below the minimum threshold
Can I use graphs, figures, and charts?
Yes BUT ensure you reference them and don't just plop them into your essay without context or connection, e.g. you have a graph of youth voting trends, you'd write something like 'As seen in Chart 2, the overall pattern since 1990 in Canada has been ...' (Stats Can)
If it's from a book or article, both Chicago and MLA require page numbers for 
Can I use personal examples and anecdotes? 
No
Not evidence or proof, as it'll be just unsubstantiated opinion or descriptive anecdote
We cannot check or verify your personal example, circumstance or situation, so we cannot confirm what you are claiming about your experience as evidence or proof of a point. It is one thing to say, "I was walking late at night and thinking about the comment someone made to me that made me think about whether there is a right to free speech" versus "I was walking late at night with friends, and some rando yelled something nasty at us; but me and my five friends agreed that in Canada they had a right to free speech even if we were insulted, so that proves there is right to free speech as me and my friends all agreed" -- this second sentence is long and rambling, and most importantly, it is not proof or support either
This includes: stories about your life or those of others or fictionalized accounts
You need ethics approval to quote a person with whom you have spoken/interviewed/etc., so this is a huge problem if you don't follow the U's rule on interviewing rules, protocols, etc.
Can I use anecdotes, family stories, conversations with my friends, or examples from my personal experiences as evidence or proof? 
NO. At best, they can be a short hook or attention-catcher to pique the reader's interest in the Intro, BUT they are NOT themselves arguments or evidence
You need ethics approval to quote a person with whom you have spoken/interviewed/etc., so this is a huge problem if you don't follow the U's rule on interviewing rules, protocols, etc.
May I use any of the Textbooks for BACKGROUND or IDEA information? 
ONLY in a LIMITED and MINIMAL WAY
You can cite a particular idea to from the textbooks but don't use the textbook as evidence, e.g. cite Wolff IPP explaining Mill on the 'harm principle' but don't use Wolff's evidence/example/arguments/objections/etc.
Using and citing Textbooks will not count for the minimum academic sources, verification for your claimes, etgc.
Can I use a TED Talk, YouTube video, etc.?
Not recommended
A Ted Talk or reasonable YouTube video, etc., (not an unreasonable video source( would be treated like any other non-scholarly source
Often, the TED presenters have book, etc. to which you can look for the info and points they are discussing so recommend finding a written record of their points if possible
Technically you need to have a transcript, and you need to cite the timestamp (start and finish) for the source, and a narrower time stamp for a quote or paraphrase
Ensure you provide all the relevant info as per MLA or Chicago style (author, title, name of conference/convenor, URL, etc.
Again, TED talks are broad discussions, usually with one or two examples or anecdotes, so you don't get the full detailed account as you would from a written piece
May I cite Lectures?
No
May I use or cite my TA comments on my EBO as evidence, etc.? 
NO 
Sources: Citations
Should I state my Citation Style -- MLA or Chicago -- on the top of my first page or on my cover page
Yes
Please make your Essay's Citation Style clear somewhere at the start of your Essay, whether you have a cover page or not
Can I change my Citation Style from my EBO to the other one?
Yes
Either way, ensure you use either MLA or Chicago
Do I have to provide page numbers for articles? 
Yes
Both Chicago and MLA require page numbers
No having page numbers is the same as NOT having a citation may be considered as 'no citations' but definitely will be heavily downgraded
Do ALL scholarly sources need page #s in the citations?
YES
Always provide page numbers for your citations of scholarly sources
Both Chicago and MLA require page numbers
If my scholarly sources is from a website, like Weldon, Sage journals, etc., doo need page #s in the citations?
YES
Always provide page numbers for your citations of scholarly sources
Both Chicago and MLA require page numbers
Do not treat scholarly sources as citations like web-sources which follow a whole different style -- the source may be found on/through  
Do I cite at the level of sentences not paragraphs? What if it is all from the same source?
Cite always at the level of the sentence, even if it's the same source 3 sentences in a row, etc., you cite in each sentence
Do not do one citation set at the end of a paragraph as that will not be clear as to what you are citing and where in that para (quote? paraphrase? idea referenced?) and will be downgraded
Do I have to provide page numbers for chapters from edited books/e-books? 
IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, you should provide page #s for the chapter only
Example in MLA style:  Bousfield, Dan. "Faith, Fantasy, and Crisis: Racialized Financial Discipline in Europe". Psychoanalysis and the Global. Ed. Ilan Kapoor, University of Nebraska Press, 2018, 29-43.
What if something does not have proper page numbers on the document, what should I do to cite?
Articles all have page numbers, so you have to do a little digging to find the page numbers
You need to provide page numbers for all your articles, e.g. 725-73
Google to see if it has been cited somewhere else and maybe it'll give up 
If I’m quoting a source that is inside another source, do I have to cite the original source or the source I got it from?
The source you got it from, e.g. Beier had argued that “the TRC has …” (Biswas-Mellamphy, 52) = this tells the reader you got the Beier quote from the Biswas-Mellamphy source
It would be dishonest to say you read the original source when you did not
It would be protective, in case the source you got it from got their other source’s quote, info, etc. wrong, you’d not be in trouble for that
What if I have multiple citations for the same sentence?
The all go in the same citation but separate them with a semi-colon:
MLA: (Jones, 52; Morrison, 355; Westmacott, 1789)
Chicago: 1. Jones, 52; Morrison, 355; Westmacott, 1789.
Do I have to divide up my sources in my Essay by source type?
No
Bibliographies/Works Cited should be single alphabetized list of sources
You will be downgraded for not alphabetizing, indenting, missing publication information, etc., for a proper citation same as the EBO
Does the Bibliography or Works Cited count in the Word Count?
No
What Word Count leeway is given for the Works Cited or Bibliography
Take approx. 100 words off your Word Count = one page single-spaced approximately < depends on the number of sources you have in your WC or Bibliography (if you only have 2 sources, that's like no more than 30-40 words)
Do MLA in-line/bracket Citations count for the Word Count? 
No
So, this will likely be about max. 100 words as well
NOTE: If you are using Footnotes/Endnotes, TURN OFF the counting of Footnotes/Endnotes in your Word Count
Do I have to check the Citations listing when I copy it from the Library Citation generator, ezBib, etc., into my Bibliography or ?
Yes.
Check to make sure the name of the journal and the page numbers are there in particular, as these two tend to be the info often missing when there is an error in auto-generators 
If I'm using MLA Works Cited, may I still list my sources I referenced/read even though I did not actually cite them in the Essay?
Yes, that's fine
For our purposes, we are allow Works Cited to be more like Chicago's Bibliography model (which does not require all sources to have been cited in the essay text)
Should I provide both inline bracket citations MLA citations and footnotes/endnotes Chicago citations?
NO!
Use only 1/one citation style (also affects your Works Cited and Bibliography style, which should match the style you are using)
Use inline bracket citation OR footnotes OR endnotes -- don't use more than 1/one style!
Are sources only counted as meeting the minimum academic sources only if they are cited?
Yes
If you don't use and cite a source, it is not going to be counted 
Should I provide both inline bracket citations MLA citations and footnotes/endnotes Chicago citations?
NO!
Use
Should I provide both inline bracket citations MLA citations and footnotes/endnotes Chicago citations?
NO!
How many citations per page should I have?
There is no fix number needed
You do need to ensure you are citing other people's ideas, where you got some lesser-known fact, where you are drawing an argument from, what is the source of your claim or evidence or quote
Usually, about 5 citations per page to show you can deploy your sources well and provide support for your claim, but your actual number may be more or less?
Is there a such thing as 'overciting'?
Cite appropriately and show you know how to cite
If you keep citing everything everywhere endlessly your essay will appear to have none of your ideas or analysis or thoughts
Formatting & Organization
Should I make time to edit?
Yes
Aim to be clear and succinct your writing, as expanding interconnected sentences and complexifying language choices just obfuscate from your intended argumentation (see what I did there: should've edited that ...)
Choose clarity: an essay is likely to do better if the reader TA-marker can understand what you are arguing, etc. -- indeed grade on essay (more) is correlated to the inverse of time taken to get through it (less
Do I need a separate title page?
No but you are welcome to have one
For either Chicago or MLA you can do so but not required
What information is recommended I put at the top of my first page or on a title page?
Your Name
Your TAs Name
Put Prof's name (one or both of us)
Title of your Essay -- can be as simple as "Free Speech" or complex like "TikBallot? InstaVote? Countering Declining Youth Participation in Formal Politics in North America"
Citation Style (either MLA or Chicago)
As this is an electronic submission via OWL, so while we have info 1-3 known to us but it's good to get in the habit of writing a formal top page or title page
Submission
Is there a particular file-name format I have to use?
No
Use only alphabet/letters and numbers, e.g. "PoliSci Essay Nig 1"
Don't use special characters like: *, !, %, etc.
Don't use a Period/'.' in your file name as that WILL mess up the file extension, etc.
Can I submit an Apple/Pages file?
No 
Only Word .doc or .docx OR PDF
Can I submit a Google doc file?
No 
Only Word .doc or .docx OR PDF
Can I submit an RTF file?
Not recommended as it will lose formatting, etc. 
Only Word .doc or .docx OR PDF
Can I submit a Text file?
Not recommended as it will lose formatting, etc.
Only Word .doc or .docx OR PDF
Can I submit an OneDrive file/folder link?
No
Can I submit an Google file/folder link?
No
Can I submit an OneDrive file/folder link?
No
Can I submit an AmazonDrive file/folder link?
No
Can I submit an OneDrive file/folder link?
No
Can I submit an DropBox file/folder link?
No
I should ONLY submit a Word .doc/.docx or PDF file?
Yes
Should I check the OWL site submission to make sure I submitted the right file, the right version, the right document, etc.?
Yes
What if I catch a last minute error, then can I resubmit?
You can but ONLY UNTIL the deadline on the submission link can you resubmit a corrected version > it will override your old submission with the new one ONLY if submitted by the deadline time
No submissions after the link is closed
What if the link closes as I'm submitting?
If you are uploading, and OWL is uploading your file, but it rolls past the deadline, it will just show as "Late" BUT that Late indicates OWL did upload it so you're good and won't be penalized as late
What do I do if I missed the on-time submission deadline and the link is closed?
It's late SO keep working on it and then submit at the next available deadline
What do I do if I missed the late submission deadlines and the link is closed?
Unless you have accommodation, you will NOT be permitted to submit the assignment and will receive 0
Is the Late Penalty per day or a flat/one-time penalty?
THE LATE PENALTY IS A FLAT -10% PENALTY
Draft Checker
How do I make sense of the Draft Checker's results, i.e. how do I interpret them?

Generally, you want LESS THAN 15% OVERALL match
If you have a whole bunch 3%'s or less adding up to a large number, that's not an issue
Generally, you want NO SINGLE SOURCE to be over 3% but definitely beyond 5% is an issue
You can check your Word Count either in Document Viewer by clicking the "Circled-i" in the bottom left; or in top mast head under Text-only View
Bibliography and Quoted materials (if properly in quotes, but not bloc quotes) have been excluded
Specific to each Essay Question
1.Should Canada pursue the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Focus on 2-3 recommendations.

Can I do more than 3 recommendations?
No
Should I explain each recommendation briefly before arguing for pursuing them or not?
Yes; a brief summary will let the Reader know what you understand to be the recommendation which you will be discussing
2.Should nuclear weapons be banned?

Can I argue only some types of nuclear weapons should be banned?
Not recommended because you'll have to develop and show in-depth knowledge of the types of nuclear weapons and technology, so this will be difficuly task to sort through and do well
Is this about states banning nuclear weapons only?
No; while state level bans, which is basically a state agreeing it won't develop nuclear weapons, this question about a global ban
Should I be discussing UN efforts to ban nuclear weapons?
Sure BUT you can also discuss efforts by states and non-governmental organizations as well
3. Are global pandemics best managed by international cooperation or by states acting on their own?

Can suggest both international cooperation and states need to work together?
You still need to be clear to the Reader which one are you suggesting is to be dominant because suggestion both/equal is not a clear thesis
Suggesting they work together, ask yourself which one them needs to dominate/control
Do I have to suggest a particular international organization or organizations, like the WHO or UN, etc., manage?
No
Do I have to suggest a particular state or states, like Russia, Brazil, Togo, Trindad & Tobago, etc., manage?
No
4. Is the American War on Terror a failure?

Does the paper have to about the 'War on Terror' or can I just talk about terrorism generally?
It's specifically about the War on Terror, so you need to ensure you understand the WoT and perhaps a para explaining it so you and the Reader are on the same page in your understanding about the WoT
5. Should Canada be accepting more refugees?

Are refugees the same as immigrants?
No
Are asylum-seekers the same as refugees?
Yes
Are refugees the same as displaced-persons?
Not exactly, so stick with refugees
Is the question about specific refugees like from Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Venezuela, Ukraine, etc?
